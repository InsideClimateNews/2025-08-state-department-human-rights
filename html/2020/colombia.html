				<hr>
<p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong> The Department of State will release 
an addendum to this report in mid 2021 that expands the subsection on 
Women in Section 6 to include a broader range of issues related to 
reproductive rights.â</p>
<hr>
<p>Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty republic. Presidential and 
legislative elections were held in 2018. Voters elected Ivan Duque 
Marquez president in a second round of elections that observers 
considered free and fair and the most peaceful in decades.</p>
<p>The Colombian National Police force is responsible for internal law 
enforcement and is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense. 
The Migration Directorate, part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is 
the immigration authority. The Colombian National Police shares law 
enforcement investigatory duties with the Attorney Generalâs Corps of 
Technical Investigators. In addition to its responsibility to defend the
 country against external threats, the army shares limited 
responsibility for law enforcement and maintenance of order within the 
country. For example, military units sometimes provided logistical 
support and security for criminal investigators to collect evidence in 
high-conflict or remote areas. Civilian authorities generally maintained
 effective control over security forces. Members of the security forces 
committed some abuses.</p>
<p>Significant human rights issues included: reports of unlawful or 
arbitrary killings; reports of torture and arbitrary detention by 
government security forces and illegal armed groups; rape and abuse of 
women and children, as well as unlawful recruitment of child soldiers by
 illegal armed groups; criminalization of libel; widespread corruption; 
violence against and forced displacement of Afro-Colombian and 
indigenous persons; violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and intersex persons; child labor; and killings and other 
violence against trade unionists.</p>
<p>The government took steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish 
officials who committed human rights abuses, although some cases 
continued to experience long delays.</p>
<p>Illegal armed groups, including dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed
 Forces of Colombia (FARC), National Liberation Army (ELN), and 
drug-trafficking gangs, continued to operate. Illegal armed groups, as 
well as narcotics traffickers, were significant perpetrators of human 
rights abuses and violent crimes and committed acts of extrajudicial and
 unlawful killings, extortion, and other abuses, such as kidnapping, 
torture, human trafficking, bombings, restriction on freedom of 
movement, sexual violence, recruitment and use of child soldiers, and 
threats of violence against journalists, women, and human rights 
defenders. The government investigated these actions and prosecuted 
those responsible to the extent possible.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were reports that the government or its agents committed 
arbitrary or unlawful killings. According to the nongovernmental 
organization (NGO) Center for Research and Education of the Populace 
(CINEP), from January 1 through August 19, there were 15 cases of 
âintentional deaths of civilians committed by state agents.â</p>
<p>For example, in June a group of army soldiers allegedly killed rural 
community leader Salvador Jaime Duran in the department of Norte de 
Santander. A local community association responded by detaining six army
 soldiers whom they identified as responsible for the killing, 
ultimately turning the soldiers over to the Attorney Generalâs Office. 
According to press reports, army officials said they were in the area 
conducting security and defense operations when they were attacked. The 
investigation into the killing continued as of the end of August.</p>
<p>On September 8, police officers allegedly killed civilian Javier 
Humberto Ordonez Bermudez in Bogota. According to press reports, Ordonez
 was drinking publicly in violation of COVID-19 restrictions and 
officers told him he would be fined for public intoxication. A video of 
the incident shows police officers using taser shocks and beating 
Ordonez to restrain him. Ordonez later died in the hospital, and an 
autopsy revealed the beating was the cause of death. President Duque, 
the minister of defense, and other government officials condemned the 
killing, and authorities arrested the two police officers allegedly 
responsible. The inspector general banned the two officers from public 
service for 20 years. The attorney general appointed a special human 
rights prosecutor to lead the investigation into the killing. Ordonezâ 
killing sparked widespread demonstrations.</p>
<p>Illegal armed groups, including the ELN, committed numerous unlawful 
or politically motivated killings, often in areas without a strong 
government presence (see section 1.g.).</p>
<p>Investigations of past killings proceeded, albeit slowly. From 
January 1 through August, the Attorney Generalâs Office registered 25 
new cases of alleged aggravated homicide by state agents for killings 
that occurred between 2008 and August 2020. During the same period, 
authorities formally charged six members of the security forces with 
aggravated homicide or homicide of a civilian, with all six of those 
crimes occurring in previous years.</p>
<p>Efforts continued to hold officials accountable in âfalse positiveâ 
extrajudicial killings, in which thousands of civilians were killed and 
falsely presented as guerrilla combatants in the late 1990s to early 
2000s. As of June the Attorney Generalâs Office reported the government 
had convicted 1,740 members of the security forces in 270 cases related 
to false positive cases since 2008.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office reported there were open investigations
 of 14 retired and active-duty generals related to false positive 
killings as of August. The Attorney Generalâs Office also reported there
 were 2,286 open investigations related to false positive killings or 
other extrajudicial killings as of July 31.</p>
<p>In addition the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), the justice 
component of the Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation, 
and Nonrepetition provided for in the 2016 peace accord with the FARC, 
continued to take effective steps to hold perpetrators of gross 
violations of human rights accountable in a manner consistent with 
international law. This included activities to advance Case 003, focused
 on extrajudicial killings or âfalse positivesâ committed by the First, 
Second, Fourth, and Seventh Army Divisions. As of August 31, the JEP 
reported it had received 250 âvoluntary versionsâ in the case from 
alleged perpetrators recounting their versions of events that occurred 
during the conflict. Such testimony led investigators to uncover a mass 
grave of alleged false positive victims in the department of Antioquia. 
On July 25, retired army general William Henry Torres Escalante admitted
 his responsibility for false positives before the JEP and apologized to
 the families of the victims.</p>
<p>In 2019 there were allegations that military orders instructing army 
commanders to double the results of their missions against guerillas, 
criminal organizations, and illegal armed groups could heighten the risk
 of civilian casualties. An independent commission established by 
President Duque to review the facts regarding these alleged military 
orders submitted a preliminary report in July 2019 concluding that the 
orders did not permit, suggest, or result in abuses or criminal conduct,
 and that the armed forcesâ operational rules and doctrine were aligned 
with human rights and international humanitarian law principles. As of 
September a final report had not been issued.</p>
<p>Human rights organizations, victims, and government investigators 
accused some members of government security forces of collaborating with
 or tolerating the activities of organized-crime gangs, which included 
some former paramilitary members. According to the Attorney Generalâs 
Office, between January and September, nine members of government 
security forces were formally accused of having ties with illegal armed 
groups.</p>
<p>According to a February 26 report from the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), there were 108 
verified killings of social leaders and human rights defenders in 2019. 
According to the Attorney Generalâs Office, in the cases of more than 
400 killings of human rights defenders from January 2016 to August 2020,
 the government had obtained 60 convictions. According to the OHCHR, 75 
percent of the 2019 social leader killings occurred in rural areas, and 
98 percent occurred in areas where the ELN and other criminal groups 
were present. The motives for the killings varied, and it was often 
difficult to determine the primary or precise motive in individual 
cases. For example, on March 19, armed men reportedly kidnapped and 
killed crop substitution activist Marco Rivadeneira in Puerto Asis, 
Putumayo. On April 10, authorities arrested Abel Antonio Loaiza 
Quinonez, alias âAzul,â in Puerto Asis. According to officials in the 
Attorney Generalâs Office, Azul was a senior member of an illegal armed 
group linked to several killings in the region, possibly including the 
killing of Rivadeneira.</p>
<p>The Commission of the Timely Action Plan for Prevention and 
Protection for Human Rights Defenders, Social and Communal Leaders, and 
Journalists, created in 2018, strengthened efforts to investigate and 
prevent attacks against social leaders and human rights defenders. The 
Inspector Generalâs Office and the human rights ombudsman continued to 
raise awareness on the situation of human rights defenders through the 
public âLead Lifeâ campaign, in partnership with civil society, media, 
and international organizations. Additionally, there is an elite corps 
of the National Police, a specialized subdirectorate of the National 
Protection Unit (NPU), a special investigation unit of the Attorney 
Generalâs Office responsible for dismantling criminal organizations and 
enterprises, and a unified command post, which shared responsibility for
 protecting human rights defenders from attacks and investigating and 
prosecuting these cases.</p>
<p>By law the Attorney Generalâs Office is the primary entity 
responsible for investigating allegations of human rights abuses 
committed by security forces, with the exception of conflict-related 
crimes, which are within the jurisdiction of the JEP (see section 1.c. 
for additional information regarding investigations and impunity).</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Disappearance</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports of disappearances by or on behalf of 
government authorities during the year. According to the National 
Institute of Forensic and Legal Medicine, from January 1 through June, a
 total of 2,052 cases of disappearances were registered, including 53 
forced disappearances. The government did not provide information on the
 number of victims of disappearances who were located.</p>
<p>According to the Attorney Generalâs Office, as of October there were no convictions in connection with forced disappearances.</p>
<p>The Special Unit for the Search for Disappeared Persons, launched in 
2018, continued to investigate disappearances that occurred during the 
conflict.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>Although the law prohibits such practices, there were reports 
government officials employed them. CINEP reported that through August, 
security forces were allegedly involved in six cases of torture, 
including nine victims. Members of the military and police accused of 
torture generally were tried in civilian rather than military courts.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office reported it convicted 18 members of the
 military or police force of torture between January and July 31, all 
for crimes occurring in previous years. In addition the Attorney 
Generalâs Office reported 50 continuing investigations into alleged acts
 of torture committed by the police or armed forces through July. All 
but one of the investigations were linked to alleged crimes committed in
 previous years.</p>
<p>CINEP reported organized-crime gangs and illegal armed groups were 
responsible for six documented cases of torture through August.</p>
<p>According to NGOs monitoring prison conditions, there were numerous 
allegations of sexual and physical violence committed by guards and 
other inmates. In June seven members of the army were charged with 
raping a 12-year-old indigenous girl in the department of Risaralda. The
 Attorney Generalâs Office was investigating the incident and 
prosecuting the accused persons. According to one NGO, police officers 
allegedly sexually assaulted three women who were protesting police 
violence in September.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office is the primary entity responsible for 
investigating allegations of human rights abuses committed by security 
forces, with the exception of conflict-related crimes, which are within 
the jurisdiction of the JEP. The JEP continued investigations in its 
seven prioritized macro cases with the objective of identifying patterns
 and establishing links between perpetrators, with the ultimate goal of 
identifying those most criminally responsible for the most serious 
abuses during the conflict.</p>
<p>Some NGOs complained that military investigators, not members of the 
Attorney Generalâs Office, were sometimes the first responders in cases 
of deaths resulting from actions of security forces and might make 
decisions about possible illegal actions. The government made 
improvements in investigating and trying cases of abuses, but claims of 
impunity for security force members continued. This was due in some 
cases to obstruction of justice and opacity in the process by which 
cases were investigated and prosecuted in the military justice system. 
Inadequate protection of witnesses and investigators, delay tactics by 
defense attorneys, the judiciaryâs failure to exert appropriate controls
 over dockets and case progress, and inadequate coordination among 
government entities that sometimes allowed statutes of limitations to 
expireâresulting in a defendantâs release from jail before trialâwere 
also significant obstacles.</p>
<p>The military justice system functioned under both the old 
inquisitorial and a newer accusatory justice system, which was not yet 
fully implemented. Transition to the new system continued slowly, and 
the military had not yet developed an interinstitutional strategy for 
recruiting, hiring, or training investigators, crime scene technicians, 
or forensic specialists, which is required under the accusatory system. 
As such, the military justice system did not exercise criminal 
investigative authority; all new criminal investigation duties were 
conducted by judicial police investigators from the CNP and the Attorney
 Generalâs Corps of Technical Investigators.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h3>

					
					<p>With the exception of some new facilities, prisons and detention
 centers were harsh and life threatening due to overcrowding, inadequate
 sanitary conditions, poor health care, and lack of other basic 
services. Poor training of officials remained a problem throughout the 
prison system.</p>
<p><u></u>Physical Conditions: Overcrowding existed in menâs and in 
womenâs prisons. The National Prison Institute (INPEC), which operated 
the national prisons and oversaw the jails, estimated there were 106,700
 persons incarcerated in 132 prisons at a rate of approximately 29 
percent over capacity. The government made efforts to decrease the 
prison population in the context of COVID-19. In March the government 
issued a decree suspending new prisoner admissions during the pandemic, 
and there was an overall slowdown in judicial proceedings during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. On April 14, the government issued a decree allowing 
for the compassionate release of prisoners who were 60 years or older, 
pregnant women, mothers of children younger than age three, persons with
 disabilities or chronic serious illnesses, those sentenced to five 
years or less, and offenders with 40 percent of their sentence complete.</p>
<p>The law prohibits holding pretrial detainees with convicted 
prisoners, although this frequently occurred. Juvenile detainees were 
held in separate juvenile detention centers. The Superior Judiciary 
Council stated the maximum time that a person may remain in judicial 
detention facilities is three days. The same rules apply to jails 
located inside police stations. These regulations were often violated.</p>
<p>The practice of preventive detention, in combination with 
inefficiencies in the judicial system, continued to result in 
overcrowding. The government continued to implement procedures 
introduced in 2016 that provide for the immediate release of some 
pretrial detainees, including many accused of serious crimes such as 
aggravated robbery and sexual assault.</p>
<p>On March 21, 24 prisoners died during a failed escape attempt at La 
Modelo Prison in Bogota. The attempted escape took place during 
coordinated riots with 19 other prisons that occurred in apparent 
response to the health and sanitation conditions exacerbated by the 
COVID-19 lockdown and suspension of prison visits. A November Human 
Rights Watch report alleged the deaths were consistent with intentional 
homicide. The attorney general and inspector general launched 
investigations into the prison authorityâs use of force during the 
attempted escape and overall handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Physical abuse by prison guards, prisoner-on-prisoner violence, and 
authoritiesâ failure to maintain control were problems. INPECâs office 
of disciplinary control continued to investigate allegations that some 
prison guards routinely used excessive force and treated inmates 
brutally. As of July 29, INPEC reported disciplinary investigations 
against 135 prison guards for such actions as physical abuse and inhuman
 treatment.</p>
<p>INPEC reported 392 deaths in prisons, jails, pretrial detention, or 
other detention centers through July 29, including 37 attributed to 
internal fights.</p>
<p>Many prisoners continued to face difficulties receiving adequate 
medical care. Nutrition and water quality were deficient and contributed
 to the overall poor health of many inmates. Inmates stated authorities 
routinely rationed water in many facilities, which officials attributed 
to city water shortages.</p>
<p>INPECâs physical structures were generally in poor repair. The 
Inspector Generalâs Office noted some facilities had poor ventilation 
and overtaxed sanitary systems. Prisoners in some high-altitude 
facilities complained of inadequate blankets and clothing, while 
prisoners in tropical facilities complained that overcrowding and 
insufficient ventilation contributed to high temperatures in prison 
cells. Some prisoners slept on floors without mattresses, while others 
shared cots in overcrowded cells.</p>
<p><u></u>Administration: Authorities investigated credible prisoner 
complaints of mistreatment and inhuman conditions, including complaints 
of prison guards soliciting bribes from inmates, but some prisoners 
asserted the investigations were slow.</p>
<p><u></u>Independent Monitoring: The government permitted independent 
monitoring of prison conditions by local and international human rights 
groups. INPEC required a three-day notice before granting consular 
access. Some NGOs complained that authorities, without adequate 
explanation, denied them access to visit prisoners. In March the 
government suspended prison visits to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention and provides 
for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness of his or her 
arrest or detention in court. There were allegations, however, that 
authorities detained citizens arbitrarily. CINEP reported 31 cases of 
arbitrary detention committed by state security forces through August 
19.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>Authorities must bring detained persons before a judge within 36
 hours to determine the validity of the detention, bring formal charges 
within 30 days, and start a trial within 90 days of the initial 
detention. Public defenders contracted by the Office of the Ombudsman 
assisted indigent defendants but were overloaded with cases. Detainees 
received prompt access to legal counsel and family members as provided 
for by law. Bail was generally available except for serious crimes such 
as murder, rebellion, or narcotics trafficking. Authorities generally 
respected these rights.</p>
<p><u></u>Arbitrary Arrest: The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and 
detention; however, this requirement was not always respected. NGOs 
characterized some arrests as arbitrary detention, including arrests 
allegedly based on tips from informants about persons linked to 
guerrilla activities, detentions by members of the security forces 
without a judicial order, detentions based on administrative authority, 
detentions during military operations or at roadblocks, large-scale 
detentions, and detentions of persons while they were âexercising their 
fundamental rights.â For example, NGOs alleged that on May 20, members 
of the armyâs Seventh Division arbitrarily detained and searched crop 
substitution leader Ariolfo Sanchez Ruiz along with a group of rural 
farmers in the department of Antioquia. According to media reports, army
 soldiers killed Sanchez. Army officials stated that soldiers were in 
the area to eradicate illicit crops and that the killing was under 
investigation.</p>
<p><u></u>Pretrial Detention: The judicial process moved slowly, and the
 civilian judicial system suffered from a significant backlog of cases, 
which led to large numbers of pretrial detainees. Of the 106,700 prison 
detainees, 29,450 were in pretrial detention. The failure of many jail 
supervisors to keep mandatory detention records or follow notification 
procedures made accounting for all detainees difficult. In some cases 
detainees were released without a trial because they had already served 
more than one-third of the maximum sentence for their charges.</p>
<p>Civil society groups complained that authorities subjected some community leaders to extended pretrial detention.</p>

					<p>The law provides for an independent judiciary, and the 
government generally respected judicial independence and impartiality. 
Much of the judicial system was overburdened and inefficient, and 
subornation, corruption, and intimidation of judges, prosecutors, and 
witnesses hindered judicial functioning.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Trial Procedures</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the right to a fair and public trial, and 
an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. While the 
government began implementing an accusatory system of justice in 2005, 
the use of delay tactics by defense lawyers to slow or impede 
proceedings, prosecutorsâ heavy caseloads, and other factors, diminished
 the anticipated increased efficiencies and other benefits of adopting 
the adversarial model. Under the criminal procedure code, the prosecutor
 presents an accusation and evidence before an impartial judge at an 
oral, public trial. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty
 beyond a reasonable doubt and have the right to confront the trial 
evidence and witnesses against them, present their own evidence, and 
communicate with an attorney of their choice or have one provided at 
public expense. Defendants had adequate time and facilities to prepare 
their defense. Defendants are not compelled to testify or confess guilt 
and have the right to appeal their proceedings. Although defendants have
 the right to an interpreter, the court system lacked interpreters for 
less commonly encountered languages. Crimes committed before 2005 are 
processed under the prior written inquisitorial system in which the 
prosecutor investigates, determines evidence, and makes a finding of 
guilt or innocence. In those cases, the trial consists of the 
presentation of evidence and finding of guilt or innocence to a judge 
for ratification or rejection.</p>
<p>In the military justice system, military judges preside over 
courts-martial. Counsel may represent the accused and call witnesses, 
but most fact finding takes place during the investigative stage. 
Military trial judges are required to issue rulings within eight days of
 a court-martial hearing. Representatives of the civilian Inspector 
Generalâs Office are required to be present at a court-martial.</p>
<p>Criminal procedure within the military justice system includes 
elements of the inquisitorial and accusatory systems. The law provides 
for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally 
enforced this right. Defendants are considered innocent until proven 
guilty and have the right to timely consultation with counsel.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-9" class="report__section-subtitle">Political Prisoners and Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>The government declared that it did not hold political 
prisoners; nevertheless, authorities held some members of human rights 
advocacy groups on charges of conspiracy, rebellion, or terrorism, which
 the groups described as government harassment against human rights 
advocates. According to INPEC, the government held 66 persons on charges
 of rebellion or of aiding and promoting insurgency. The government 
provided the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) regular 
access to these prisoners.</p>

					<p>Citizens may sue a government agent or entity in the 
Administrative Court of Litigation for damages resulting from a human 
rights violation. Although critics complained of delays in the process, 
the court generally was considered impartial and effective. Cases 
involving violations of an individualâs human rights may be submitted 
through petitions by individuals or organizations to the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, which in turn may submit the case to the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The court may order civil

					<p>The 2011 Victimsâ and Land Restitution Law (Victimsâ Law) 
continued to provide a legal basis for assistance and reparations to 
victims of the conflict, including victims of government abuses, but the
 government acknowledged that the pace of restitution was slow. From 
January through August 31, the Inspector Generalâs Office, an 
independent and autonomous public institution, assisted in 171 cases 
related to land reclamation, i.e., requests for restitution.</p>
<p>The Land Restitution Unit, a semiautonomous entity in the Ministry of
 Agriculture, is responsible for returning land to displaced victims of 
conflict. The unit reported that as of July 31, it had received 571 
requests for collective restitution of territories of ethnic 
communities.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-12" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Arbitrary or Unlawful Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits such actions, but there were allegations the 
government failed to respect these prohibitions. Government authorities 
generally need a judicial order to intercept mail or email or to monitor
 telephone conversations, including in prisons. Government intelligence 
agencies investigating terrorist organizations sometimes monitored 
telephone conversations without judicial authorization; the law bars 
evidence obtained in this manner from being used in court.</p>
<p>NGOs continued to accuse domestic intelligence or security entities of spying on lawyers and human rights defenders.</p>
<p>In May media reported that members of the intelligence community, 
including its cyber intelligence unit, had inappropriately developed 
dossiers on 130 politicians, judges, former members of the military, 
human rights defenders, and journalists. The government subsequently 
announced the dismissal of 11 army members for inappropriate 
surveillance of domestic and foreign citizens. The Attorney Generalâs 
Office reported that as of August 13, there were two criminal 
investigations underway in connection with the allegations. The 
Inspector Generalâs Office reported that as of August 31, there were 16 
disciplinary investigations of state agents in connection with the 
allegations.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-13" class="report__section-subtitle">g. Abuses in Internal Conflict</h3>

					
					<p>The government and the FARC, formerly the countryâs largest 
guerrilla insurgency group, continued to implement the 2016 peace 
accord. In 2017 the FARC completed its disarmament, and as of November 
3, nearly 14,000 former members had begun reincorporation activities, 
including the formation of a political party. An estimated 800 to 1,500 
FARC dissident members did not participate in the peace process from the
 outset. As of November FARC dissident numbers had grown to 
approximately 2,600 due to new recruitment and some former combatants 
who returned to arms. Some members of the FARC who did participate in 
the peace process alleged the government had not fully complied with its
 commitments, including ensuring the security of demobilized former 
combatants or facilitating their reintegration, while the government 
alleged the FARC had not met its full commitments to cooperate on 
counternarcotics efforts. In August 2019 a small group of FARC 
dissidents called for a return to armed conflict, alleging the 
government had not lived up to its obligations under the peace 
agreement. This did not result in a significant response from former 
FARC combatants who have been participating in the peace process. 
Following the signing of the 2016 peace accord, three transitional 
justice mechanisms were established and were operational throughout the 
year: the Commission for the Clarification of Truth, Coexistence, and 
Nonrepetition; the Special Unit for the Search for Disappeared Persons; 
and the JEP.</p>
<p>The ELN, a leftist guerilla force of approximately 2,500 armed 
members, continued to commit crimes and acts of terror throughout the 
country, including bombings, violence against civilian populations, and 
violent attacks against military and police facilities. Illegal armed 
groups and drug gangs, such as the Gulf Clan, also continued to operate.
 The Colombia-Europe-United States Coordination Group and other NGOs, 
considered some of these illegal armed groups to be composed of former 
paramilitary groups. The government acknowledged that some former 
paramilitary members were active in illegal armed groups but noted these
 groups lacked the national, unified command structure and explicit 
ideological agenda that defined past paramilitary groups, including the 
disbanded United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia.</p>
<p><u></u>Killings: The military was accused of some killings, some of 
which military officials stated were âmilitary mistakesâ (see section 
1.a.). In other cases military officials stated they believed an 
individual was fighting on behalf of an illegal armed group, while 
community members stated the victim was not a combatant. On May 18, 
media reported members of the armyâs Second Division killed Emerito 
Digno Buendia Martinez in Cucuta and injured three other rural farmers. 
According to a statement from the army, soldiers in the area engaged in 
illicit crop eradication efforts were fired upon first. Community 
leaders and NGOs disputed the armyâs account and denounced the killing.</p>
<p>Armed groups, notably the ELN, FARC dissidents, and the Gulf Clan, 
committed unlawful killings, primarily in areas with illicit economic 
activities and without a strong government presence. Government 
officials assessed that most of the violence was related to narcotics 
trafficking enterprises.</p>
<p>Independent observers raised concerns that inadequate security 
guarantees facilitated the killing of former FARC militants. According 
to the UN Verification Mission, as of November 3, a total of 232 FARC 
former combatants had been killed since the signing of the 2016 peace 
accord. The Attorney Generalâs Office reported 22 cases with 
convictions, 15 in the trial stage, 17 under investigation, and 44 with 
pending arrest warrants. The United Nations also reported the government
 began to implement additional steps to strengthen security guarantees 
for former FARC combatants, including deploying additional judicial 
police officers and attorneys to prioritized departments, promoting 
initiatives for prevention of stigmatization against former combatants, 
and establishing a roadmap for the protection of political candidates, 
including the FARC political party.</p>
<p><u></u>Abductions: Organized-crime gangs, FARC dissidents, the ELN, 
and common criminals continued to kidnap persons. According to the 
Ministry of Defense, from January 1 to June 30, there were 13 
kidnappings, five attributed to the ELN, and the remaining attributed to
 other organized armed groups. On August 12 in Pailitas, Cesar, the ELN 
allegedly kidnapped farmer Andres Jose Herrera Orozco.</p>
<p>Between January and June, the Ministry of Defense reported 15 
hostages had been freed, one hostage died in captivity, and seven were 
released after pressure from the government.</p>
<p>The Special Unit for the Search for Disappeared Persons provided for 
in the peace accord is mandated to account for those who disappeared in 
the context of the armed conflict and, when possible, locate and return 
remains to families. According to the Observatory of Memory and 
Conflict, more than 80,000 persons were reported missing as a result of 
the armed conflict, including 1,214 military and police personnel who 
were kidnapped by the FARC and ELN.</p>
<p><u></u>Physical Abuse, Punishment, and Torture: From January through 
August, CINEP reported FARC dissidents and organized-crime gangs were 
responsible for nine documented cases of torture.</p>
<p>The ELN, FARC dissidents, and other groups continued to lay land 
mines. According to the Integral Action against Land Mines of the High 
Commissioner for Peace, there were 13 persons killed and 74 wounded as 
the result of improvised explosive devices and land mines between 
January 1 and September 1.</p>
<p><u></u>Child Soldiers: There were reports the ELN, FARC dissident 
groups, the Gulf Clan, and other illegal armed groups recruited persons 
younger than age 18. According to the Child and Family Welfare 
Department, 6,860 children separated from armed illegal groups between 
November 16, 1999, and July 31, 2020. The government concluded a program
 to counter recruitment of child soldiers that had reached 500 at-risk 
villages, an estimated 28,250 minors, and 15,000 families. It announced 
the next iteration of the child recruitment prevention program in July 
that expanded the definition of recruitment measures, including the use 
of children for illicit economies and sexual coercion. Government and 
NGO officials confirmed rates of child recruitment increased with the 
appearance of COVID-19 and related confinement measures.</p>
<p><u></u>Other Conflict-related Abuse: During the year reports of other
 human rights abuses occurred in the context of the conflict and 
narcotics trafficking. Drug traffickers and illegal armed groups 
continued to displace predominantly poor and rural populations (see 
section 2.e., Status and Treatment of Internally Displaced Persons).</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for freedom of expression, including for the 
press, and the government generally respected this right. Violence and 
harassment, as well as the criminalization of libel, inhibited freedom 
of the press, and the government frequently influenced the press, in 
part through its large advertising budgets. The independent media were 
active and expressed a wide variety of views without restriction.</p>
<p><u></u>Violence and Harassment: According to the domestic NGO 
Foundation for Press Freedom (FLIP), through August 14, there were 98 
threats against journalists, some involving more than one target, for a 
total of 126 journalists affected by threats. FLIP reported 304 
incidents of violence or harassment, including 80 journalists who were 
physically assaulted. According to FLIP, one journalist, Jose Abelardo 
Liz, was killed in connection with his work. Liz, an indigenous radio 
journalist, worked for a radio station in Corinto, Cauca. FLIP also 
reported that between January and August, no journalists were illegally 
detained. The Attorney Generalâs Office reported that from January 
through August, they obtained seven convictions in cases of homicides of
 journalists.</p>
<p>As of July 31, the NPU provided protection services to 182 
journalists. Some NGOs raised concerns about perceived shortcomings in 
the NPU, such as delays in granting protection and the appropriateness 
of measures for addressing specific threats.</p>
<p><u></u>Censorship or Content Restrictions: FLIP alleged some 
journalists practiced self-censorship due to fear of being sued under 
libel laws or of being physically attacked, mostly by nongovernment 
actors. FLIP asserted that the high degree of impunity for those who 
committed aggressions against journalists was also a factor. In May 
media reported that members of the intelligence community 
inappropriately followed, monitored, and profiled 52 journalists.</p>
<p><u></u>Libel/Slander Laws: By law slander and libel are crimes. The 
government did not use prosecution to prevent media outlets from 
criticizing government policies or public officials. Political 
candidates, businesspersons, and others, however, publicly threatened to
 sue journalists for expressing their opinions, alleging defamation or 
libel. FLIP reported that through August 22, there were 88 cases 
alleging libel or slander affecting 98 journalists.</p>
<p><u></u>Nongovernmental Impact: Members of illegal armed groups 
inhibited freedom of expression by intimidating, threatening, 
kidnapping, and killing journalists. National and international NGOs 
reported local media representatives regularly practiced self-censorship
 because of threats of violence from these groups. For example, media 
reported that eight journalists in the department of Magdalena received 
death threats from the ELN in August.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Internet Freedom</h3>

					
					<p>The government did not restrict or disrupt access to the 
internet or censor online content, and there were no credible reports 
that the government monitored private online communications without 
appropriate legal authority. Due to the general climate of impunity and 
violence in some areas, self-censorship occurred both online and 
offline, particularly within rural communities.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Freedom of Peaceful Assembly</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the freedom of peaceful assembly, and the 
government generally respected this right. Some NGOs alleged that riot 
police (Esmad) used excessive force to break up demonstrations. The CNP 
reported that from January through August 5, a total of 28 Esmad members
 were under investigation in connection with 13 cases of excess use of 
force. The Inspector Generalâs Office separately reported 94 active 
disciplinary actions against Esmad during the year. In June a coalition 
of social organizations began a 16-day march from Popayan to Bogota to 
draw attention to the violence in rural territories. Participating 
organizations alleged harassment by police along the way.</p>
<p>On September 9-10, following the killing of Javier Humberto Ordonez 
Bermudez, there were violent protests in Bogota in response to the 
alleged excessive use of force by the police. According to media 
reports, protesters destroyed 50 neighborhood police outposts and at 
least 10 persons died during two nights of demonstrations. The Ministry 
of Defense reported that ELN and FARC dissidents infiltrated the 
protests and provoked violence.</p>
<p>In September, October, and November, labor federations, student 
groups, and human rights organizations staged a separate set of largely 
peaceful demonstrations throughout the country to protest a range of 
social and economic conditions and policies. According to police 
estimates, there were 142 centers of protest activity countrywide during
 the September protests, including caravans, marches, and rallies.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Freedom of Association</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the freedom of association, and the 
government generally respected this right. Freedom of association was 
limited, however, by threats and acts of violence committed by illegal 
armed groups against NGOs, indigenous groups, and labor unions.</p>
<p>Although the government does not prohibit membership in most 
political organizations, membership in organizations that engaged in 
rebellion against the government, espoused violence, or carried out acts
 of violence, such as FARC dissidents, the ELN, and other illegal armed 
groups, was against the law.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Freedom of Movement</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign 
travel, emigration, and repatriation. The government generally respected
 these rights, although there were exceptions. Military operations and 
insecurity in certain rural areas restricted freedom of movement.</p>
<p><u></u>In-country Movement: The government required asylum seekers and individuals without regularized migration status to have a <i>salv</i><i>o</i><i>conducto</i>
 (safe passage document) to travel throughout the country. Illegal armed
 groups continued to establish checkpoints on rural roads and took 
advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to establish their own curfews and 
movement restrictions in an effort to expand their territorial control.</p>
<p>International and civil society organizations also reported that 
illegal armed groups confined rural communities through roadblocks, 
curfews, car bombs at egress routes, and improvised explosive devices in
 areas where illicit crop cultivation and narcotics trafficking 
persisted. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs, by the end of September, 61,000 persons lived in 
communities that suffered from confinement, limiting their access to 
essential goods and services due to armed incidents and geographical 
factors.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-9" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Status and Treatment of Internally Displaced Persons</h3>

					
					<p>There were approximately eight million internally displaced 
persons (IDPs) in the country, largely a result of the armed conflict 
and continuing violence in rural areas. Threats posed by illegal armed 
groups drove internal displacement in remote areas as well as urban 
settings. After the 2016 peace accord, FARC withdrawal resulted in a 
struggle for control by other illegal armed groups, causing violence and
 internal displacement. The government, international organizations, and
 civil society groups identified various factors causing displacement, 
including threats, extortion, and physical, psychological, and sexual 
violence by illegal armed groups against civilian populations, 
particularly women and girls. Other causes of displacement included 
competition and armed confrontation among and within illegal armed 
groups for resources and territorial control; confrontations between 
security forces, guerrillas, and organized-crime gangs; and forced 
recruitment of children or threats of forced recruitment. Drug 
trafficking, illegal mining, and large-scale commercial ventures in 
rural areas also contributed to displacement. Local institutions that 
lacked the capacity in many areas to protect the rights of, and provide 
public services to, IDPs and communities at risk of displacement were 
impacted by the COVID-19 national quarantine. Consequently, the 
government continued to struggle to provide adequate protection or 
humanitarian assistance to newly displaced populations.</p>
<p>The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported 
that approximately 37,760 persons were affected in 84 displacement 
events in 2019 and that 15,400 persons were affected in 52 displacement 
events between January and August 21. Departments with the highest rate 
of mass displacements included Antioquia, Cauca, Choco, Narino, and 
Norte de Santander.</p>
<p>The Victimsâ Unit maintained the Single Victims Registry as mandated 
by law. Despite improvements in the government registration system, IDPs
 experienced delays in receiving responses to their displacement claims 
due to a large backlog of claims built up during several months, lack of
 the unitâs presence in rural areas, and other constraints. The closure 
of many government offices during the months-long national quarantine 
due to COVID-19 resulted in many IDPs being unable to file their 
displacement claims. Government policy provides for an appeals process 
in the case of refusals.</p>
<p>The ELN and other armed groups continued to use force, intimidation, 
and disinformation to discourage IDPs from registering with the 
government. International organizations and civil society expressed 
concern over urban displacement caused by violence stemming from 
territorial disputes between criminal gangs, some of which had links to 
larger criminal and narcotics trafficking groups.</p>
<p>The Victimsâ Unit cited extortion, forced recruitment by illegal 
armed groups, killings, and physical and sexual violence as the primary 
causes of intraurban displacement. The UN High Commission for Refugees 
(UNHCR) reported that in some departments displacement 
disproportionately affected indigenous and Afro-Colombian groups.</p>
<p>As of June the government registered approximately 361,150 IDPs who 
identified as indigenous, and 1,114,350 who identified as 
Afro-Colombian. Indigenous persons constituted approximately 4.5 percent
 and Afro-Colombians approximately 14 percent of new IDPs registered by 
the government.</p>
<p>The NGO National Association of Displaced Afrodescendants (AFRODES) 
stated that threats and violence against Afro-Colombian leaders and 
communities continued to cause high levels of forced displacement, 
especially in the Pacific Coast region. AFRODES and other local NGOs 
expressed concern that large-scale economic projects, such as 
agriculture and mining, contributed to displacement in their 
communities.</p>
<p>By law 52 government agencies are responsible for assisting 
registered IDPs. In addition dozens of international organizations; 
international NGOs; domestic nonprofit groups; and multilateral 
organizations, including the International Organization for Migration, 
World Food Program, ICRC, UNHCR, and Colombian Red Cross, coordinated 
with the government to provide emergency relief and long-term assistance
 to displaced populations.</p>
<p>International organizations and NGOs remained concerned about the 
slow and insufficient institutional response to displacement. As a 
result, NGOs took responsibility for providing humanitarian assistance 
to recently displaced individuals. International organizations and civil
 society reported that a lack of local capacity to accept registrations 
in high-displacement areas often delayed assistance to persons displaced
 individually or in smaller groups. Humanitarian organizations 
attributed the delays to a variety of factors, including the lack of 
personnel, funding, declaration forms, and training. Insecurity in 
communities affected by the conflict and reduced mobility during the 
COVID-19 national quarantine, including areas in the departments of 
Antioquia, Cauca, Choco, Narino, and Norte de Santander, often delayed 
national and international aid organizations from reaching newly 
displaced populations.</p>
<p>Despite several government initiatives to enhance IDP access to 
services and awareness of their rights, municipalities in many parts of 
the country did not have the resources or capacity to respond to new 
displacements and provide humanitarian assistance to IDPs. Many IDPs 
continued to live in poverty in unhygienic conditions and with limited 
access to health care, education, shelter, and employment. During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, some humanitarian organizations increased health 
promotion education and the distribution of hygiene supplies.</p>
<p>The government estimated that 400,000 to 500,000 Colombians, many of 
whom had been displaced by the conflict in Colombia and registered as 
refugees in Venezuela, prior to the signing of the 2016 peace accord, 
had returned from Venezuela as of August.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-10" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Protection of Refugees</h3>

					
					<p>The government cooperated with UNHCR and other humanitarian 
organizations in providing protection and assistance to internally 
displaced persons, refugees, returning refugees, asylum seekers, 
stateless persons, or other persons of concern.</p>
<p><u></u>Access to Asylum: The law provides for the granting of asylum 
or refugee status, and the government has established a system for 
providing protection to refugees. The government reported it had 
approved 339 requests for recognition of refugee status in 2019 and was 
processing a caseload of 17,000 requests it received in 2019 and 2020. 
Venezuelans represented approximately 95 percent of applications during 
the year. The government increased the validity period of a 
salvoconducto from three months to six months and removed the previous 
bar on employment for permit holders. The newly opened asylum office in 
Bogota cleared its case backlog dating back to 2017.</p>
<p>There was a steady migration flow from Venezuela until the closure of
 international borders in March, due to the COVID-19 national 
quarantine. Despite the closure of international borders, some 
humanitarian travel continued to be allowed. Since March an estimated 
110,000 Venezuelans returned to their country. According to migration 
officials, as of August the country hosted more than 1.7 million 
Venezuelans, a net decrease from the beginning of the year. As 
Colombiaâs economy began reopening after September 1, Venezuelans began 
entering Colombia again even though the official land border remained 
closed. While the government generally provided access to the asylum 
process for persons who requested international protection, many opted 
for alternative migration status. The government continued to grant 
Colombian citizenship to Venezuelan children born in Colombia on or 
after August 19, 2015, and by August approximately 46,000 children born 
to Venezuelan parents in Colombia had received citizenship.</p>
<p><u></u>Temporary Protection: The government also provided temporary 
residence permits (PEPs) to Venezuelans who met certain eligibility 
requirements. Approximately 690,000 Venezuelans who entered with 
passports legally were granted PEPs in the 2017-2019 period, according 
to migration officials. PEPs provide access to work, primary and 
secondary education, and the social insurance system, as well as the 
ability to open bank accounts. Migration officials announced an open

				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides citizens the ability to choose their government
 through free and fair periodic elections held by secret ballot and 
based on nearly universal suffrage. Active-duty members of the armed 
forces and police may neither vote nor participate in the political 
process. Civilian public employees are eligible to vote, although they 
may participate in partisan politics only during the four months 
immediately preceding a national election.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-3__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Elections and Political Participation</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Recent Elections: Legislative and presidential elections 
were held in March and May 2018, respectively. Because no presidential 
candidate won more than 50 percent of the vote in the election, as 
required for a victory in the first round, in June a second election was
 held, in which voters elected Ivan Duque Marquez president. Observers 
considered the elections free and fair and the most peaceful in decades.
 There were no reports of election-related violence during the June 2018
 presidential runoff, in which the candidate of the Democratic Center 
party, Ivan Duque Marquez, defeated the candidate of Humane Colombia, 
Gustavo Francisco Petro Urrego. The then minister of defense, Luis 
Carlos Villegas Echeverri, described it as the most peaceful election in
 decades. The leading domestic elections NGO, Electoral Observation 
Mission, deployed 3,524 nonpartisan volunteers to monitor the elections.
 International observers included an electoral observation mission of 
the Organization of American States. The first local and regional 
elections since the signing of the 2016 peace accord took place in 
October 2019 and were largely peaceful and the most inclusive in the 
countryâs history. Observers reported some indications of electoral 
fraud, including vote buying.</p>
<p><u></u>Political Parties and Political Participation: Organized-crime
 gangs, FARC dissidents, and the ELN threatened and killed government 
officials (see section 1.g.). As of June 31, the NPU, under the Ministry
 of Interior, was providing protection to 421 mayors, 20 governors, and 
787 other persons, including members of departmental assemblies, council
 members, judges, municipal human rights officers, and other officials 
related to national human rights policies. By decree the CNPâs 
protection program and the NPU assume shared responsibility for 
protecting municipal and district mayors.</p>
<p>As part of the 2016 peace accord, the FARC registered a political 
party in 2017 under the name Peopleâs Alternative Revolutionary Force, 
maintaining the same acronym. The accord guaranteed the FARC political 
party 10 seats in Congressâfive each in the Senate and in the House of 
Representativesâin the 2018 and 2022 elections.</p>
<p><u></u>Participation of Women and <u></u>Members of <u></u>Minorit<u></u>y
 Groups: No laws limit the participation of women or members of minority
 groups in the political process, and they did participate.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-4" class="report__section-title">Section 4. Corruption and Lack of Transparency in Government</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for official corruption, and
 the government generally implemented these laws effectively, although 
officials sometimes engaged in corrupt practices without punishment. 
Revenues from transnational organized crime, including drug trafficking,
 exacerbated corruption.</p>
<p><u></u>Corruption: Through September the Attorney Generalâs Office 
registered 30,724 allegations related to corruption and registered 4,070
 formal corruption charges. In April the comptroller general, the 
attorney general, and the inspector general established a unit to 
monitor funds allocated as part of the COVID-19 response, following 
allegations of corruption. The Attorney Generalâs Office announced 
investigations into more than 40 public officials, including the 
minister of agriculture, governors, and mayors, for corruption related 
to the administration of contracts for COVID-19 emergency support.</p>
<p><u></u>Financial Disclosure: By law public officials must file annual
 financial disclosure forms with the tax authority. The information is 
not made public. The law states that persons who intend to hold public 
office or work as contractors for the government for more than three 
months shall submit a statement of assets and income as well as 
information on their private economic activity. The human resources 
chief in each entity is responsible for verifying the information 
submitted. Congress maintained a website on which members could 
voluntarily post their financial information.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A wide variety of domestic and international human rights groups
 generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
were typically cooperative and willing to listen to local human rights 
groupsâ concerns.</p>
<p>Several NGOs reported receiving threats in the form of email, mail, 
telephone calls, false obituaries, and objects related to death, such as
 coffins and funeral bouquets. The government condemned the threats and 
called on the Attorney Generalâs Office to investigate them. Some 
activists claimed the government did not take the threats seriously.</p>
<p>The government announced advances in the investigations into attacks 
and killings of human rights defenders and assigned priority resources 
to these cases.</p>
<p>Through July the Attorney Generalâs Office reported 471 active 
investigations into threats against human rights defenders. There were 
three convictions in cases of threats against human rights defenders 
during the year.</p>
<p>As of July the NPUâs protection program provided protection to more 
than 7,000 individuals. Among the NPUâs protected persons were 5,144 
human rights activists.</p>
<p><u></u>Government Human Rights Bodies: The ombudsman is independent, 
submits an annual report to the House of Representatives, and has 
responsibility for providing for the promotion and exercise of human 
rights. According to human rights groups, underfunding of the 
Ombudsmanâs Office limited its ability to monitor violations 
effectively. The ombudsman, as well as members of his regional offices, 
reported threats from illegal armed groups issued through pamphlets, 
email, and violent actions.</p>
<p>The National System for Human Rights and International Humanitarian 
Lawâled by a commission of 18 senior government officials, including the
 vice presidentâdesigns, implements, and evaluates the governmentâs 
policies on human rights and international humanitarian law. The Office 
of the Presidential Advisor for Human Rights coordinates national human 
rights policy and actions taken by government entities to promote or 
protect human rights.</p>
<p>Both the Senate and House of Representatives have human rights 
committees that served as forums for discussion of human rights 
problems.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">Women</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Rape and Domestic Violence: Although prohibited by law, 
rape of men or women, including spousal rape, remained a serious 
problem. The law provides for sentences ranging from eight to 30 yearsâ 
imprisonment for violent sexual assault. For acts of spousal sexual 
violence, the law mandates prison sentences of six months to two years. 
By law femicide is punishable with penalties of 21 to 50 years in 
prison, longer than the minimum sentence of 13 years for homicide.</p>
<p>Violence against women, as well as impunity for perpetrators, 
continued to be a problem. Members of illegal armed groups continued to 
rape and abuse women and children sexually. Family-violence hotlines 
reported a 160 percent increase in calls during the COVID-19 national 
quarantine.</p>
<p>The government continued to employ the Elite Sexual Assault 
Investigative Unit interagency unit in Bogota, which was dedicated to 
the investigation of sexual assault cases. From January through July, 
the Attorney Generalâs Office opened 58,000 investigations into domestic
 violence, with women identified as the victim in 39,000 of those 
investigations.</p>
<p>The law requires the government to provide victims of domestic 
violence immediate protection from further physical or psychological 
abuse.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense continued implementing its protocol for 
managing cases of sexual violence and harassment involving members of 
the military. The district secretary of women in Bogota and the 
Ombudsmanâs Office offered free legal aid for victims of gender violence
 and organized courses to teach officials how to treat survivors of 
gender violence respectfully.</p>
<p>The law augments both imprisonment and fines if a crime causes 
âtransitory or permanent physical disfigurement,â such as acid attacks, 
which have a penalty of up to 50 years in prison.</p>
<p><u></u>Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C): The law prohibits 
FGM/C, but isolated incidents were reported in several indigenous 
communities in different parts of the country. Two-thirds of women from 
the Embera community had undergone FGM/C, according to the UN Population
 Fund.</p>
<p><u></u>Sexual Harassment: The law provides measures to deter and 
punish harassment in the workplace, such as sexual harassment, verbal 
abuse or derision, aggression, and discrimination, which carries a 
penalty of one to three yearsâ imprisonment. Nonetheless, NGOs reported 
sexual harassment remained a pervasive and underreported problem in 
workplaces and in public.</p>
<p><u></u>Coercion in Population Control: Coerced abortion is not 
permitted under the law, and there were no reports of coerced abortion 
or involuntary sterilization on the part of government authorities. The 
law, however, allows the involuntary surgical sterilization of children 
with cognitive and psychosocial disabilities in certain cases.</p>
<p>Through August 31, the Attorney Generalâs Office reported opening five investigations related to cases of forced abortion.</p>
<p><u></u>Discrimination: Although women have the same legal rights as 
men, discrimination against women persisted. The Office of the Advisor 
for the Equality of Women has primary responsibility for combating 
discrimination against women, but advocacy groups reported that the 
office remained seriously underfunded. The government continued its 
national public policy for gender equity.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Children</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Birth Registration: Citizenship is derived by birth 
within the countryâs territory in most cases. Most births were 
registered immediately. If a birth is not registered within one month, 
parents may be fined and denied public services.</p>
<p><u></u>Child Abuse: Child abuse was a serious problem. The Attorney 
Generalâs Office reported almost 7,850 criminal prosecutions for sexual 
crimes against minors through August. The Colombian Family Welfare 
Institute (ICBF) reported that between January and June 30, there were 
approximately 4,730 cases of child abuse in addition to 5,250 cases of 
sexual abuse of a minor. The ICBF provided psychosocial, legal, and 
medical care to victims.</p>
<p><u></u>Child, <u></u>Early<u></u>,<u></u> and Forced Marriage: 
Marriage is legal at the age of 18. Boys older than 14 and girls older 
than 12 may marry with the consent of their parents. According to 
UNICEF, 5 percent of girls were married before age 15 and 23 percent 
before age 18.</p>
<p><u></u>Sexual Exploitation of Children: Sexual exploitation of 
children remained a problem. The law prohibits sexual exploitation of a 
minor or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a minor and stipulates a
 penalty of 14 to 25 years in prison, with aggravated penalties for 
perpetrators who are family members of the victim and for cases of 
sexual tourism, forced marriage, or sexual exploitation by illegal armed
 groups. The law prohibits pornography using children younger than 18 
and stipulates a penalty of 10 to 20 years in prison and a fine for 
violations. The minimum age for consensual sex is 14. The penalty for 
sexual activity with a child younger than 14 ranges from nine to 13 
years in prison. The government generally enforced the law.</p>
<p>On May 27, police dismantled a child sexual-trafficking ring in the 
department of Meta. Police raided a residential building after neighbors
 reported suspicious activity. When police officers entered, they found 
five rooms where âwebcam modelingâ was taking placeâminors performing 
sex acts for a live virtual audience for a fee. Police captured the 
webcam business owner and her recruiter. As of September they were 
facing charges of pornography with an underage person, forced 
prostitution, and facilitation to offer sexual activities with persons 
younger than 18. According to media reports, the economic fallout from 
COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase in âwebcam modeling.â</p>
<p><u></u>Displaced Children: The NGO Consultancy for Human Rights and 
Displacement estimated in 2016 that 31 percent of persons registered as 
displaced since 1985 were minors at the time they were displaced (see 
also section 2.e.).</p>
<p><u></u>International Child Abductions: The country is a party to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs <i>Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction</i> at <a class="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210330220800/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data/reported-cases.html" target="_self"> <span class="external-link-title">https://

					<p>The Jewish community, which had an estimated 5,000 members, 
continued to report instances of anti-Israeli rhetoric connected to 
events in the Middle East, accompanied by anti-Semitic graffiti near 
synagogues, as well as demonstrations in front of the Israeli embassy 
that were sometimes accompanied by anti-Semitic comments on social 
media. In particular the Colombian Confederation of Jewish Communities 
expressed concern over the presence of BDS (Boycott, Divestment, 
Sanctions) Colombia, which promotes the boycott of Israeli products and 
travel and does not actively counter the conflation of anti-Israeli 
policies with anti-Semitic rhetoric.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Persons with Disabilities</h3>

					
					<p>The law punishes those who arbitrarily restrict the full 
exercise of the rights of persons with disabilities or harass persons 
with disabilities, but enforcement was rare. The law prohibits 
discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities but
 does not explicitly prohibit discrimination against persons with 
sensory or intellectual disabilities. No law mandates access to 
information and telecommunications for persons with disabilities. Law 
1996, adopted in 2019, recognizes that persons with disabilities older 
than 18 have full legal capacity.</p>
<p>The Office of the Presidential Advisor for Human Rights under the 
high counselor for postconflict, public security, and human rights, 
along with the Human Rights Directorate at the Ministry of Interior, is 
responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities. 
According to Somos Defensores and other NGOs, the law was seldom 
enforced.</p>
<p>Although children with disabilities attended school at all levels, 
advocates noted the vast majority of teachers and schools were neither 
trained nor equipped to educate children with disabilities successfully.
 Advocacy groups also stated children with disabilities entered the 
education system later than children without disabilities and dropped 
out at higher rates. Persons with disabilities were unemployed at a much
 higher rate than the general population.</p>
<p>In 2013 the State Council ordered all public offices to make 
facilities accessible to persons with disabilities and asked public 
officials to include requirements for accessibility when granting 
licenses for construction and occupancy. The State Council also asked 
every municipality to enforce rules that would make all public offices 
accessible to persons with disabilities âin a short amount of time.â It 
was not clear if much progress had been made at the municipal level, but
 several government ministries reported progress, such as adding ramps, 
designating parking spaces, and improving bathroom access.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Members of National/Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups</h3>

					
					<p>According to the 2018 national census, approximately 9.3 percent
 of the countryâs population described themselves as being of African 
descent. A 2011 UN report estimated Afro-Colombians made up 15 to 20 
percent of the population, while human rights groups and Afro-Colombian 
organizations estimated the proportion to be 20 to 25 percent.</p>
<p>Afro-Colombians are entitled to all constitutional rights and 
protections, but they faced significant economic and social 
discrimination. According to a 2016 UN report, 32 percent of the 
countryâs population lived below the poverty line, but in Choco, the 
department with the highest percentage of Afro-Colombian residents, 79 
percent of residents lived below the poverty line. NGOs and the OHCHR 
reported that Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities continued to be 
disproportionately affected by illicit economic activities in rural 
territories that lacked sufficient state presence.</p>
<p>The government continued a policy to promote equal opportunity for 
black, Afro-Colombian, Palenquera, and Raizal populations. (Palenquera 
populations inhabit some parts of the Caribbean coast, Raizal 
populations live in the San Andres Archipelago, and Blacks and 
Afro-Colombians are Colombians of African descent who self-identify 
slightly differently based on their unique linguistic and cultural 
heritages.) The Ministry of Interior provided technical advice and 
funding for social projects presented by Afro-Colombian communities.</p>
<p>The National Autonomous Congress of Afro-Colombian Community Councils
 and Ethnic Organizations for Blacks, Afro-Colombians, Raizals, and 
Palenqueras, consisting of 108 representatives, met with government 
representatives on problems that affected their communities.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">Indigenous People</h3>

					
					<p>The law gives special recognition to the fundamental rights of 
indigenous persons, who make up approximately 4.4 percent of the 
population, and require the government to consult beforehand with 
indigenous groups regarding governmental actions that could affect them.</p>
<p>The law accords indigenous groups perpetual rights to their ancestral
 lands, but indigenous groups, neighboring landowners, and the 
government often disputed the demarcation of those lands. Traditional 
indigenous groups operated 842 reservations, accounting for 
approximately 28 percent of the countryâs territory. Illegal armed 
groups often violently contested indigenous land ownership and recruited
 indigenous children to join their ranks.</p>
<p>The law provides for special criminal and civil jurisdictions within 
indigenous territories based on traditional community laws. Legal 
proceedings in these jurisdictions were subject to manipulation and 
often rendered punishments more lenient than those imposed by civilian 
state courts.</p>
<p>Some indigenous groups continued to assert they were not able to 
participate adequately in decisions affecting their lands. The 
constitution provides for a âprior consultationâ mechanism for 
indigenous communities, but it does not require the government to obtain
 the consent of those communities in all cases. In October indigenous 
communities convened in several cities to hold a protest known as a <i>m</i><i>inga</i>
 to draw attention to violence in rural territories and to press for 
increased government attention to the 2016 peace accord implementation.</p>
<p>The government stated that for security reasons, it could not provide
 advance notice of most military operations, especially when in pursuit 
of enemy combatants, and added that it consulted with indigenous leaders
 when possible before entering land held by their communities.</p>
<p>Despite special legal protections and government assistance programs,
 indigenous persons continued to suffer discrimination and often lived 
on the margins of society. They belonged to the countryâs poorest 
population and had the highest age-specific mortality rates.</p>
<p>Killings of members and leaders of indigenous groups remained a 
problem. According to the NGO National Indigenous Organization of 
Colombia, since the signing of the peace accord, 274 indigenous persons 
had been killed. The OHCHRâs February report noted particular concern 
for the safety of indigenous communities, particularly in the department
 of Cauca, where the OHCHR registered the killing of 66 members of the 
indigenous Nasa people. In July soldiers from the armyâs Second Division
 allegedly killed indigenous leader Joel Aguablanca Villamizar during a 
military operation targeting the ELN.</p>
<p>Despite precautionary measures ordered by the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, ethnic Wayuu children continued to die of 
malnutrition. According to a 2015 government survey, 77 percent of 
indigenous households in the department of La Guajira, where the largest
 number of Wayuu lived, were food insecure. An August Human Rights Watch
 report stated that the travel restrictions associated with the 
governmentâs COVID-19 national quarantine severely limited the Wayuuâs 
access to food.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Acts of Violence, Criminalization, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h3>

					
					<p>There were allegations of police violence based on sexual 
orientation. There were no reports of official discrimination based on 
sexual orientation in employment, housing, statelessness, or access to 
education; however, there were reports of discrimination with respect to
 access to health care. The government approved a national action plan 
to guarantee lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) 
rights for the 2019-2022 period. In August the constitutional court 
determined that medical insurance companies must bear the costs of 
gender affirmation and reassignment surgeries.</p>
<p>Despite government measures to increase the rights and protection of 
LGBTI persons, there were reports of societal abuse and discrimination 
as well as sexual assault. NGOs claimed transgender individuals, 
particularly transgender men, were often sexually assaulted in so-called
 corrective rape. In the first eight months of the year, the Ombudsmanâs
 Office reported 388 cases of violence against LGBTI persons, up from up
 from 309 cases in the whole of 2019. The primary forms of abuse were 
physical, sexual, and psychological aggression, in addition to economic 
discrimination.</p>
<p>The Ombudsmanâs Office reported the killings of 63 LGBTI persons from
 January to August and also cited 36 cases of aggression by police 
officers. The majority of the victims were transgender women. In July an
 unknown assailant shot and killed LGBTI leader Mateo Lopez Mejia in 
Circasia, Quindio, while he led a community event in a sports complex. 
As of August the Attorney Generalâs Office reported 29 open 
investigations into excessive use of force by military or police against
 LGBTI persons.</p>
<p>Transgender individuals cited barriers to public services when 
health-care providers or police officers refused to accept their 
government-issued identification. Some transgender individuals stated it
 was difficult to change their gender designation on national identity 
documents and that transgender individuals whose identity cards listed 
them as male were required to show proof they had performed mandatory 
military service or obtained the necessary waivers from that service. As
 part of COVID-19 national quarantine, some cities instituted movement 
restrictions based on gender. NGOs noted this resulted in discrimination
 against the transgender community and a loss of access to services.</p>

Bogota allegedly refused to provide medical care upon learning the

paramedics left. Bogota city officials subsequently opened an 
investigation. In its most recent demographic and health survey (2015), 
the government reported the responses of 78 percent of those surveyed

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the right of workers to form and join 
unions, bargain collectively, and conduct legal strikes, and it 
prohibits antiunion discrimination. Members of associated workersâ 
cooperatives are not allowed to form unions, since the law recognizes 
members of a cooperative as owners. The law prohibits members of the 
armed forces and police from forming or joining unions. The law provides
 for automatic recognition of unions that obtain 25 signatures from 
potential members and that comply with a registration process. 
Public-sector employees have the right to bargain collectively. The 
government and employers generally respected freedom of association and 
collective bargaining in practice.</p>
<p>The law permits associated workersâ cooperatives (CTAs), collective 
pacts, and union contracts. Under collective pacts, employers may 
negotiate accords on pay and labor conditions with workers in workplaces
 where no union is present or where a union represents less than 
one-third of employees. Law and regulations prohibit the use of CTAs and
 collective pacts to undermine the right to organize and bargain 
collectively, including by extending better conditions to nonunion 
workers through such pacts. Through a union contract, a company may 
contract a union, at times formed explicitly for this purpose, for a 
specific job or work; the union then in essence serves as an employer 
for its members. Workers who belong to a union that has a union contract
 with a company do not have a direct employment relationship with either
 the company or the union. Labor disputes for workers under a union 
contract may be decided through an arbitration panel versus labor courts
 if both parties agree.</p>
<p>The law does not permit members of the armed forces, police, and 
persons performing âessential public servicesâ to strike. Before 
conducting a strike, unions must follow prescribed legal procedures, 
including entering into a conversation period with the employer, 
presenting a list of demands, and gaining majority approval in the union
 for a strike. The law limits strikes to periods of contract 
negotiations or collective bargaining and allows employers to fire trade
 unionists who participate in strikes or work stoppages ruled illegal by
 the courts.</p>
<p>The government has the authority to fine labor rights violators. The 
law stipulates that offenders repeatedly misusing CTAs or other labor 
relationships shall receive the maximum penalty and may be subject to 
losing their legal status to operate. Employers who engage in antiunion 
practices may also be imprisoned for up to five years, although 
government officials acknowledged a fine was more likely than 
imprisonment. Prohibited practices include impeding workersâ right to 
strike, meet, or otherwise associate, and extending better conditions to
 members of collective pacts than to union members. The penalties under 
the law, which are commensurate with those prescribed for other 
violations regarding denials of civil rights such as discrimination, 
would be sufficient to deter violations but were not levied 
consistently.</p>
<p>Government enforcement of applicable laws was inconsistent. Despite 
steps by the Ministry of Labor to strengthen its labor law inspection 
system, the government did not establish a consistent national strategy 
to protect the rights to freedom of association and collective 
bargaining. The government did not have in place a system to ensure 
timely and regular collection of fines related to these protections. 
Structural challenges adversely affected prosecutions, which resulted in
 a continued high rate of impunity for violators of these rights, 
including in cases of threats and violence against unionists.</p>
<p>In March and April, the Ministry of Labor passed multiple resolutions
 requiring the Vice Ministry of Labor Relations and Inspections and 
other labor law enforcement agencies to comply with national mandates 
aiming to prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as to ensure proper 
oversight of petitions stemming from the labor and employment impacts of
 the pandemic and national lockdown. These resolutions stipulated that 
the labor inspectorate suspend activities entailing physical contact 
with parties during the national health emergency, including field-based
 inspections and activities of the mobile inspection units as well as 
hearings related to the conciliation of labor conflicts, with exceptions
 as determined by regional- and national-level officials. The 
resolutions also suspended the labor inspectorateâs review and 
adjudication of labor complaints, including conducting investigations 
and adjudicating fines and appeals, for violations not directly related 
to the pandemic, including illegal labor intermediation (abusive 
subcontracting) and freedom of association violations.</p>
<p>Excepted from these measures were COVID-19-related priorities such as
 Ministry of Labor outreach on labor law compliance, including on 
occupational safety and health issues, as well as administrative actions
 related to petitions regarding layoffs and furloughs stemming from the 
pandemic and lockdown. The measures established that because furloughs 
and layoffs had a national economic and social impact, all petitions, 
including those filed with the ministryâs regional offices, were 
centralized and handled by the ministryâs Special Investigations Unit 
for rigorous oversight (see section 7.e.). This unit, which is part of 
the labor inspectorate, has the power to investigate and impose 
sanctions in any jurisdiction. Under normal circumstances, the vice 
minister of labor relations and inspections decides on a case-by-case 
basis whether to assign the unit or the regional inspectors to 
investigate a particular worksite or review a particular case. Prior to 
the onset of COVID-19, the unit was reportedly overburdened with cases, 
resulting in denials of union requests for review. In September the 
Ministry of Labor passed a resolution lifting the suspension of the 
review and adjudication of non-COVID-19-related labor cases.</p>
<p>As part of its commitments under the 2011 labor action plan, the 
government continued to take steps to protect internationally recognized
 labor rights. Inspections by the Ministry of Labor for abusive 
subcontracting in the five priority sectors of palm oil, sugar, ports, 
mines, and cut flowers were, however, infrequent, prior to the 
COVID-19-related suspension of inspections. Critics claimed inspections 
lacked necessary rigor, assessed fines were not collected, and abusive 
subcontracting continued. Prior to the onset of COVID-19, it was unclear
 whether there were any new fines assessed for abusive subcontracting or
 for abuse of freedom of association in any of the five priority 
sectors. The government continued to engage in regular meetings with 
unions and civil society groups on these and related issues.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor, in collaboration with the International Labor 
Organization (ILO), continued to train labor inspectors through a 
virtual training campus to prepare labor inspectors to identify abusive 
subcontracting and antiunion conduct, among other violations. It also 
implemented methods, including contract and process maps, as strategic 
planning tools to prioritize interventions. The ministry continued to 
employ a telephone- and internet-based complaint mechanism to report 
alleged labor violations. Union members complained that the systems did 
not allow citizens to register anonymous complaints and noted that 
complaints registered through the telephone and internet systems did not
 result in action.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor leads a tripartite Interinstitutional 
Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Human Rights of 
Workers, with participation by the government, organized labor groups, 
and the business community. As of August the commission met virtually 
two times during the year, once in Bogota and once in Pasto.</p>
<p>Judicial police, the Technical Investigation Body, and prosecutors 
investigating criminal cases of threats and killings are required to 
determine during the initial phase of an investigation whether a victim 
is an active or retired union member or is actively engaged in union 
formation and organization, but it was unclear whether they did so. It 
could take several months to transfer cases from regional field offices 
of the Attorney Generalâs Office to the Attorney Generalâs Human Rights 
Directorate, and cases are transferred only with the approval of the 
attorney general in response to direct requests, instead of 
automatically.</p>
<p>The government continued to include in its protection program labor 
activists engaged in efforts to form a union, as well as former 
unionists under threat because of their past activities. As of August 
the NPU was providing protection to 301 trade union leaders or members. 
Less than 1 percent of the NPUâs budget was dedicated to unionist 
protection as of August. Between January 1 and July 31, the NPU 
processed 193 risk assessments of union leaders or members; 150 of those
 individuals were assessed as facing an âextraordinary threat,â and the 
NPU provided them protection measures. The NPU reported that the average
 time needed to implement protection measures upon completion of a risk 
analysis was 60 days in regular cases or five days for emergency cases. 
NGOs complained that this length of time left threatened unionists in 
jeopardy.</p>
<p>The protection and relocation of teachers falls under the Ministry of
 National Education and the departmental education secretaries, but the 
NPU retains some responsibilities for the risk analysis and protection 
of family members. According to the Attorney Generalâs Office, through 
July 31, one unionized teacher was registered as a victim of homicide.</p>
<p>In cases of unionist killings from previous years, the pace of 
investigations and convictions remained slow, and high rates of impunity
 continued, although progress was made in the rate of case resolution. 
The Attorney Generalâs Office reported receiving 217 cases of homicides 
of unionists between January 2011 and July 2020. Whereas between January
 2011 and August 2016, there were 20 sentences for homicides issued, 
between September 2016 and July 2020, an âelite groupâ working under a 
national strategy to prioritize cases of homicides against unionists 
reached 40 sentences. Labor groups stated more needed to be done to 
address impunity for perpetrators of violence against trade unionists 
and the large number of threat cases.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office reported the killing of eight trade 
unionists through July. In 2019 the Attorney Generalâs Office reported 
10 trade unionists killed, down from 24 in 2018. The National Union 
School (ENS), a labor rights NGO and think tank, reported 14 trade 
unionists were killed through August. The ENS and other labor groups 
stated that focusing on killings alone masked the true nature and scope 
of the violence against labor activists. Labor groups noted that in some
 regions, nonlethal violations continued to increase. Through August the
 ENS reported 38 death threats, nine nonlethal attacks, one case of 
forced disappearance, and seven cases of harassment.</p>
<p>Violence, threats, harassment, and other practices against trade 
unionists continued to affect the exercise of the right to freedom of 
association and collective bargaining.</p>
<p>Unions cited multiple instances in which companies fired employees 
who formed or sought to form new unions. Some employers continued to use
 temporary contracts, service agencies, and other forms of 
subcontracting, including cooperatives, to limit worker rights and 
protections. Fines assessed by the government did little to dissuade 
violators because fines were often not collected. The government 
continued to reach formalization agreements with firms engaged in 
abusive subcontracting or that had labor conflict during the year. In 
the first two months of the year, prior to the onset of COVID-19 and the
 related suspension of administrative actions by the Ministry of Labor, 
the Vice Ministry of Labor Relations and Inspections reported 62 workers
 benefited from six formalization agreements that the Ministry of Labor 
reached with employers in key sectors, including commerce, agriculture, 
health, and transport. During this time, however, there were no 
formalization agreements reached in any of the five priority sectors. 
Labor rights groups expressed concern that previously signed 
formalization agreements were not sufficiently monitored by the 
ministry.</p>
<p>Labor confederations and NGOs reported that business owners in 
several sectors used âsimplified stock corporationsâ (SAS), union 
contracts, foundations, or temporary-service agencies in attempts to 
circumvent legal restrictions on cooperatives. While in theory SAS 
workers may exercise their right to organize and bargain collectively 
with SAS management, it appeared that in some cases the SAS had little 
or no control over the conditions of employment. The Ministry of Labor 
stated that a SAS, like any corporate structure, may be fined for labor 
violations. Labor confederations and NGOs reported these enforcement 
actions did not address the scope of abusive subcontracting and illegal 
labor intermediation in the country.</p>
<p>The port workersâ labor union reported Buenaventura port operators 
engaged in abusive subcontracting through SAS and that Ministry of Labor
 inspections and adjudication of cases at the Buenaventura port were 
ineffective in safeguarding the rights to freedom of association and 
collective bargaining.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor. The 
government did not effectively enforce the law in all cases, and there 
were reports that such practices occurred. The law prescribes 
punishments sufficient to deter violations. The ILO noted the law 
permits military conscripts to be compelled to undertake work beyond 
that of a military nature, such as activities designed to protect the 
environment or natural resources.</p>
<p>There were reports ELN guerrillas and organized-crime gangs used 
forced labor, including forced child labor, in coca cultivation and 
illegal mining in areas outside government control as well as forced 
criminality, such as extortion, in urban areas. The ICBF indicated that 
between November 16, 1999, and July 31, 2019, the number of children and
 adolescents who had demobilized from illegal armed groups was 6,860, of
 whom 11 percent were indigenous and 8 percent Afro-Colombian.</p>
<p>Forced labor in other sectors, including organized panhandling, 
mining, agriculture (especially near the coffee belt), cattle herding, 
crop harvesting, forced recruitment by illegal armed actors, and 
domestic service, remained a serious problem. Afro-Colombians, 
indigenous persons, Venezuelan migrants, and inhabitants of marginalized
 urban areas were at the highest risk of forced labor, domestic 
servitude, forced begging, and forced recruitment. Authorities did not 
make efforts to investigate cases or increase inspections of forced 
labor, and officials did not have a protocol to connect labor inspectors
 with police or to provide guidance for front-line personnel on 
indicators of forced labor. This resulted in impunity for forced labor 
and unidentified victims without protection in critical sectors, such as
 floriculture, coffee production, and extractive industries.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law sets the minimum age for employment at 15 and for 
hazardous work at 18. Children ages 15 and 16 years may work no more 
than 30 hours per week, and children age 17 may work no more than 40 
hours per week. Children younger than 15 may work in arts, sports, or 
recreational or cultural activities for a maximum of 14 hours per week. 
In all these cases, working children and adolescents must have signed 
documentation filed by their parents and be approved by a labor 
inspector or other local authority.</p>
<p>The law prohibits child workers from working at night or where there 
is a risk of bodily harm or exposure to excessive heat, cold, or noise. 
The law authorizes inspectors to issue fines that would be sufficient to
 deter violations, but the government did not enforce the law 
effectively in all cases. A violation deemed to endanger a childâs life 
or threaten moral values may be punished by temporary or permanent 
closure of the establishment. Nationwide, labor inspectors are 
responsible for enforcing child labor laws and supervising the formal 
sector through periodic inspections. An estimated 80 percent of all 
child labor, however, occurred in the informal sector of the economy. 
The number of labor inspectors was insufficient to enforce the law 
effectively.</p>
<p>Government agencies carried out several activities to eradicate and 
prevent exploitative child labor. Prior to the COVID-19-related 
suspension of labor inspections in March, the Ministry of Labor 
conducted 215 worksite inspections to ensure that adolescent workers 
were employed with proper authorization and received proper protections.
 Through these inspections, 17 authorizations were revoked for 
noncompliance. With ILO assistance the government continued to improve 
cooperation among national, regional, and municipal governments on child
 labor problems. It also continued to employ a monitoring system to 
register working children, although the system was not always regularly 
updated. The government also sought to reduce demand for child labor 
through public awareness and training efforts, often working with 
international and civil society organizations.</p>
<p>The government, through the Ministry of Labor, followed the <i>National </i><i>Policy</i><i> to Prevent and </i><i>Eliminate Child Labor and Protect the Young Worker</i>.
 It also continued its roundtable discussion group, which included 
government representatives, members of the three largest labor 
confederations, and civil society. The group concentrated its efforts on
 formalizing an integrated registration system for information on child 
labor that would permit public and private entities to register 
information about child workers.</p>
<p>The government, including through a cooperative agreement between the
 Ministry of Mines and Energy and the ICBF, continued to combat illegal 
mining and formalize artisanal mining production, with goals including 
the elimination of child labor and forced labor. Regional ICBF offices 
led efforts to combat child labor in mining at the local level, working 
with the Ministry of Labor and other government agencies to coordinate 
responses. The Department for Social Prosperity continued to implement 
the More Families in Action Program to combat poverty through 
conditional cash transfers, which included a specific focus on 
addressing child labor. In interagency child labor meetings, the 
Ministry of Labor reported that whichever government presence was 
available in the areaâwhether police, the ICBF, teachers, or the 
Administrative Department for Social Prosperityâattended to children 
found working in illegal mining operations. While all agencies had 
directives on how to handle and report child labor cases, it was unclear
 whether all cases were referred to the ICBF.</p>
<p>The ICBF continued to implement several initiatives aimed at 
preventing child labor, including producing an extensive section of its 
website designed specifically for young audiences to educate children on
 child labor, their rights, and how to report child labor. The Ministry 
of Labor continued its work with the Network against Child Labor in 
which the ministry operated alongside member businesses that pledged to 
work within the network to prevent and eradicate child labor.</p>
<p>Child labor remained a problem in the informal and illicit sectors. 
The National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) collected 
and published information on the economic activities of children between
 the ages of five and 17 through a module in its Comprehensive Household
 Economic Survey during the fourth quarter of each calendar year. 
According to DANEâs most recent survey, conducted in 2019, 5.4 percent 
of children were working, with 42 percent of those engaged in 
agriculture, livestock raising, fishing, and hunting, and 30 percent in 
commerce, hotels, and restaurant work. To a lesser extent, children were
 engaged in the manufacturing and transport sectors. Children also 
routinely performed domestic work, where they cared for children, 
prepared meals, tended gardens, and carried out shopping duties. DANE 
reported that 46 percent of children who were engaged in an employment 
relationship did not receive remuneration.</p>
<p>Significant rates of child labor occurred in the production of clay 
bricks, coal, coffee, emeralds, gold, grapes, coca, pome and stone 
fruits, pornography, and sugarcane. Forced child labor was prevalent in 
the production of coca. Children were also engaged in street vending, 
domestic work, begging, and garbage scavenging. There were reports that 
children engaged in child labor in agriculture, including coffee 
production and small family production centers in the unrefined brown 
sugar market. Commercial sexual exploitation of children occurred (see 
section 6, Children). Penalties for crimes related to the worst forms of
 child labor were commensurate with penalties in law for other analogous
 serious crimes, such as kidnapping.</p>
<p>Prohibitions against children working in mining and construction were
 reportedly largely ignored. Some educational institutions modify 
schedules during harvest seasons so that children may help on the family
 farm. Children worked in the artisanal mining of coal, clay, emeralds, 
and gold under dangerous conditions and in many instances with the 
approval or insistence of their parents. The governmentâs efforts to 
assist children working in illegal mining focused on the departments of 
Amazonas, Antioquia, Bolivar, Boyaca, Caldas, Cauca, Cesar, Choco, 
Cordoba, Cundinamarca, La Guajira, Narino, Norte de Santander, and Valle
 del Cauca.</p>
<p>There continued to be instances of child trafficking with the purpose
 of forced labor in informal mines and quarries, and in private homes. 
According to government officials and international organizations, 
illegal drug traders and other illicit actors recruited children, 
sometimes forcibly, to work in their illegal activities. The ELN and 
organized crime gangs forced children into sexual servitude or 
criminality to serve as combatants or to harvest coca (see section 
1.g.). Children working in the informal sector, including as street 
vendors, were also vulnerable to forced labor. The ICBF identified 
children and adolescents who qualified for and received social services.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination with respect to employment or 
occupation based on race, ethnicity, sex, religion, political 
preference, national origin or citizenship, gender, disability, 
language, sexual orientation or gender identity, HIV-positive status or 
infection with other communicable diseases, or social status. Complaints
 of quid pro quo sexual harassment are filed not with the Ministry of 
Labor but with the criminal courts. There are legal restrictions against
 women being in employed in the construction section. The government did
 not effectively enforce the law in all cases. Penalties were not 
commensurate with laws related to civil rights, such as election 
interference.</p>
<p>Unemployment disproportionately affected women, who faced hiring 
discrimination and received salaries that generally were not 
commensurate with their education and experience. Media reported that on
 average women earned 12 percent less than men for the same work. In a 
previous year, a senior government official estimated that 85 percent of
 persons with disabilities were unemployed. Afro-Colombian labor unions 
reported discrimination in the port sector.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>The legal minimum monthly wage is approximately twice the amount
 of the poverty line; however, almost one-half of the total workforce 
earned less than the minimum wage.</p>
<p>The law provides for a regular workweek of 48 hours and a minimum 
rest period of eight hours within the week. Exceptions to this may be 
granted by the Ministry of Labor and were frequently granted in the 
mining sector. The law stipulates that workers receive premium 
compensation for nighttime work, hours worked in excess of 48 per week, 
and work performed on Sundays. The law permits compulsory overtime only 
in exceptional cases where the work is considered essential for the 
companyâs functioning.</p>
<p>The law provides for workersâ occupational safety and health (OSH) in
 the formal sector. The legal standards were generally up to date and 
appropriate for the main formal industries. The government did not 
effectively enforce OSH laws in all cases. The law does not cover 
informal-sector workers, including many mining and agricultural workers.
 In general the law protects workersâ rights to remove themselves from 
situations that endanger health or safety without jeopardy to their 
employment, although some violations of this right were reported during 
the year. In cases of formal grievances, authorities generally protected
 employees in this situation.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor is required to enforce labor laws in the formal
 sector, including OSH regulations, through periodic inspections by 
labor inspectors. Inspectors have the authority to perform unannounced 
inspections and may also initiate sanction procedures, including after 
opening investigations. The number of inspectors during the year was 
approximately the same as in 2019 and was insufficient to enforce the 
law effectively. The Ministry of Labor reported that as of January, 211 
inspectors were in provisional status. Individual labor violations can 
result in penalties insufficient to deter violations. Unionists stated 
that more fines needed to be collected to impact occupational safety and
 health problems.</p>
<p>While the governmentâs labor inspectors undertook administrative 
actions to enforce the minimum wage in the formal sector, the government
 did not effectively enforce the law in the informal sector.</p>
<p>The government continued to promote formal employment generation. 
Eligibility to enroll and pay into the traditional social security 
system, which includes health and pension plans, is conditioned on 
earning the legal minimum monthly wage. In August the Ministry of Labor 
issued a decree implementing a National Development Plan, allowing those
 that earn less than the legal minimum monthly wage, often because of 
part-time, informal, or own-account work, to contribute to a new, 
parallel âsocial protection floorâ system that includes a subsidized 
health plan and retirement savings plan. While employer abuse of this 
new system is prohibited, labor unions complained it opens the door for 
employers to move full-time workers into part-time positions to take 
advantage of the new system and announced they would legally challenge 
the measure.</p>
<p>DANE reported that in February, prior to the onset of COVID-19, 50.4 
percent of workers employed in 13 principal cities and metropolitan 
areas were paying into the pension system. The proportion of informal 
workers in 23 cities and metropolitan areas surveyed was 47.9 percent, 
according to DANE. In February, DANE reported the national unemployment 
rate was 12.2 percent. The government continued to support complementary
 social security programs to increase the employability of extremely 
poor individuals, displaced persons, and the elderly. The economic 
impacts related to COVID-19 were significant. DANE reported that the 
national unemployment rate reached 19.8 percent in June, down from 21.4 
percent in May, with the rate reaching 24.9 percent in the countryâs 13 
principal cities and metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor reported being inundated with cases related to 
the labor and employment impacts of COVID-19. In May the ministry 
reported 3,271 requests from employers for permissions to lay off or 
furlough workers and 3,510 labor complaints related to such actions 
taken by employers. Labor unions, NGOs, and workersâ organizations 
alleged a range of labor abuses related to the fulfillment of labor 
contracts during the pandemic, including employers forcing workers to 
sign unpaid leaves of absence in lieu of authorized furloughs, 
dismissals without severance pay, salary reductions under threats of 
dismissal, and the imposition of part-time, temporary, or hourly work 
with negative consequences for workersâ entitlement to social security 
benefits. In April the Minister of Labor reported opening 2,413 
investigations into these and other practices.</p>
<p>Nonunion workers, particularly those in the agricultural and port 
sectors, reportedly worked under hazardous conditions because they 
feared losing their jobs through subcontracting mechanisms or informal 
arrangements if they reported abuses. Some unionized workers who alleged
 they suffered on-the-job injuries complained that companies illegally 
fired them in retaliation for filing workers compensation claims. Only 
the courts may order reinstatement, and workers complained the courts 
were backlogged, slow, and corrupt. The Ministry of Labor may sanction a
 company found to have broken the law in this way, but it may offer no 
other guarantees to workers.</p>
<p>Security forces reported that illegal armed actors, including FARC 
dissidents, the ELN, and organized-crime groups, engaged in illegal 
mining of gold, coal, coltan, nickel, copper, and other minerals. 
Illegal mines were particularly common in the departments of Antioquia, 
Boyaca, Choco, Cundinamarca, and Valle del Cauca.</p>
<p>According to the National Mining Agency, through June 30, a total of 
80 workers died as a result of accidents in the mines, the majority due 
to explosions, poisoned atmosphere, cave-ins, and floods. The National 
Mining Agency reported 82 workers killed in 2019.</p>
