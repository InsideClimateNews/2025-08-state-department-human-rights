				<hr>
<p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong> The Department of State will release 
an addendum to this report in mid 2021 that expands the subsection on 
Women in Section 6 to include a broader range of issues related to 
reproductive rights.â</p>
<hr>
<p>Ghana is a constitutional democracy with a strong presidency and a 
unicameral 275-seat parliament. Presidential and parliamentary elections
 conducted on December 7 were generally peaceful, and domestic and 
international observers assessed them to be transparent, inclusive, and 
credible.</p>
<p>The Ghana Police Service, under the Ministry of the Interior, is 
responsible for maintaining law and order; however, the military, which 
reports to the Ministry of Defense, continued to participate in law 
enforcement activities in a support role, such as by protecting critical
 infrastructure and by enforcing measures to combat COVID-19. The 
National Intelligence Bureau handles cases considered critical to state 
security and answers directly to the Ministry of National Security. 
Civilian authorities generally maintained effective control over the 
security forces. Members of the security forces committed some abuses.</p>
<p>Significant human rights issues included: arbitrary or unlawful 
killings by the government or its agents; cases of cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment by the government or its agents; harsh
 and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest or detention; 
serious restrictions on the press, including violence and threats of 
violence, or unjustified arrests or prosecutions against journalists; 
serious acts of corruption; lack of investigation of and accountability 
for violence against women; existence of laws criminalizing consensual 
same-sex sexual conduct between adults, although rarely enforced; and 
existence of the worst forms of child labor.</p>
<p>The government took some steps to address corruption and abuse by 
officials, whether in the security forces or elsewhere in the 
government. Impunity remained a problem, however.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were a few reports that the government or its agents 
committed arbitrary or unlawful killings. Offices charged with 
investigating security force killings include the Special Investigations
 Branch of the Ghana Armed Forces and the Police Professional Standards 
Bureau.</p>
<p>In April a soldier enforcing the governmentâs COVID-19 lockdown 
killed a man suspected of smuggling. The military issued a statement 
indicating the soldier accidentally discharged his firearm during a 
scuffle with the man; witnesses disputed the statement and stated the 
soldier intentionally killed the man. Military police removed the 
soldier from his post and placed him in custody. Authorities completed 
an investigation but did not make public the results.</p>
<p>During a voter registration exercise from June to August, two persons
 died in violent protests involving ruling and opposition party 
activists at several registration locations (see section 3, Recent 
Elections).</p>
<p>The Ghana Police Service reported five persons shot and killed in the
 December 7 national elections. Subsequently a sixth person died from 
gunshot wounds. Two of the deaths occurred in Techiman South (Bono East 
Region) and involved security forces. Media and opposition personalities
 accused police and military of using intimidation to overturn election 
results. The minister of defense denied the accusations, and the 
minister of interior announced the deaths would be investigated.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Disappearance</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>While the constitution and law prohibit such practices, there 
were credible reports police beat and otherwise abused detained suspects
 and other citizens. Victims were often reluctant to file formal 
complaints. Police generally denied allegations or claimed the level of 
force used was justified.</p>
<p>In April there were multiple accusations of police aggressively 
enforcing the governmentâs COVID-19 lockdown measures. In some instances
 witnesses filmed police beating civilians with horsewhips, canes, and 
similar implements.</p>
<p>According to the <i>Conduct in UN Field Missions</i> online portal, 
there were two open allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by 
Ghanaian peacekeepers deployed to the UN Mission in South Sudan. The 
United Nations reported authorities had not provided information on 
actions taken against the alleged perpetrators. A 2019 case involved a 
staff officerâs allegedly exploitative relationship with an adult. 
Authorities stated the military judge advocate general division was 
seeking to court martial the officer, and requested that the United 
Nations make witnesses available. A 2018 case involved 12 peacekeepersâ 
alleged transactional sex with an adult. An adjudicating panel acquitted
 the peacekeepers and discharged the case for lack of evidence in 
December 2019, stating the United Nations had not made relevant 
witnesses available.</p>
<p>Impunity remained a significant problem in the Ghana Police Service. 
Corruption, brutality, poor training, lack of oversight, and an 
overburdened judicial system contributed to impunity. Police often 
failed to respond to reports of abuses and, in many instances, did not 
act unless complainants paid for police transportation and other 
operating expenses. The Office of the Inspector General of Police (IGP) 
and the Police Professional Standards Board investigated claims of 
excessive force by security force members.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h3>

					
					<p>Prison conditions were generally harsh and sometimes life 
threatening due to overcrowding, inadequate sanitary conditions, lack of
 medical care, physical abuse, and food shortages.</p>
<p><u></u>Physical Conditions: The prisons public relations officer 
reported in September 2019 that prison overcrowding reached more than 55
 percent, with a population of 15,461 inmates compared to a total prison
 capacity of 9,945 inmates. Although authorities sought to hold 
juveniles separately from adults, there were reports detainees younger 
than age 18 were held with adults. Authorities held pretrial detainees 
in the same facilities as convicts but generally in separate cells, 
although due to overcrowding in convict blocks, Nsawam Prison held some 
convicts in blocks designated for pretrial detainees. The Ghana Prisons 
Service held women separately from men.</p>
<p>While prisoners had access to potable water, food was inadequate. 
Meals routinely lacked fruit, vegetables, or meat, forcing prisoners to 
rely on charitable donations and their families to supplement their 
diet. The prisons public relations officer identified feeding of inmates
 as a key problem. The Ghana Prisons Service facilitated farming 
activities for inmates to supplement their feeding.</p>
<p>Officials held much of the prison population in buildings that were 
originally colonial forts or abandoned public or military buildings, 
which despite improvements had poor ventilation and sanitation, 
substandard construction, and inadequate space and light. The Ghana 
Prisons Service periodically fumigated and disinfected prisons. There 
were not enough toilets available for the number of prisoners, with as 
many as 100 prisoners sharing one toilet, and toilets often overflowed 
with excrement.</p>
<p>The Ghana Prisons Service largely avoided outbreaks of COVID-19 and 
other infectious diseases by conducting regular health checks on 
prisoners and relying on donations of personal protective equipment. 
Medical assistants provided medical services, but they were 
overstretched and lacked basic equipment and medicine. At Nsawam Prison a
 medical officer operated the health clinic. All prison infirmaries had a
 severely limited supply of medicine. All prisons were supplied with 
malaria test kits. Prisons did not provide dental care. Doctors visited 
prisons when required, and prison officials referred prisoners to local 
hospitals to address conditions prison medical personnel could not treat
 on site, but the prisons often lacked ambulances to transport inmates 
off site properly. To facilitate treatment at local facilities, the 
Ghana Prisons Service continued to register inmates in the National 
Health Insurance Scheme. The Ankaful Disease Camp Prison held prisoners 
with the most serious contagious diseases. Religious organizations, 
charities, private businesses, and citizens often provided services and 
materials, such as medicine and food, to the prisons.</p>
<p>Although persons with disabilities reported receiving medicine for 
chronic ailments and having access to recreational facilities and 
vocational education, a study released in 2016 found that prison 
facilities disadvantaged persons with disabilities, since they faced 
problems accessing health care and recreational facilities. No prison 
staff specifically focused on mental health, and officials did not 
routinely identify or offer treatment or other support to prisoners with
 mental disabilities.</p>
<p><u></u>A<u></u>dministration: There was no prison ombudsperson or 
comparable independent authority to respond to complaints; rather, each 
prison designated an officer-in-charge to receive and respond to 
complaints. These officers investigated complaints.</p>
<p><u></u>Independent Monitoring: The government permitted independent 
monitoring of prison conditions by local nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs), which were independent of government influence. They monitored 
juvenile confinement and pretrial detention, bail, and recordkeeping 
procedures. Local news agencies also reported on prison conditions.</p>
<p><u></u>Improvements: The NGO-led Justice for All program with the 
support of government expedited judicial review for many pretrial 
(remand) prisoners, reducing their numbers significantly. Paralegals and
 civil society were heavily involved in the program.</p>
<p>In July, President Akufo-Addo granted clemency to 794 prisoners to curb the spread of COVID-19.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law provide for protection against 
arbitrary arrest and detention, but the government frequently 
disregarded these protections.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>The law requires detainees be brought before a court within 48 
hours of arrest in the absence of a judicial warrant, but authorities 
frequently detained individuals without charge or a valid arrest warrant
 for periods longer than 48 hours. Officials detained some prisoners for
 indefinite periods by renewing warrants or simply allowing them to 
lapse while an investigation took place. The constitution grants a 
detained individual the right to be informed immediately, in a language 
the person understands, of the reasons for detention and of his or her 
right to a lawyer. Most detainees, however, could not afford a lawyer. 
While the constitution grants the right to legal aid, the government 
often did not provide it. The government has a Legal Aid Commission that
 provides defense attorneys to those in need, but it was often unable to
 do so. Defendants in criminal cases who could not afford a lawyer 
typically represented themselves. The law requires that any detainee not
 tried within a âreasonable time,â as determined by the court, must be 
released either unconditionally or subject to conditions necessary to 
compel the personâs appearance at a later court date. The definition of 
âreasonable time,â however, has never been legally determined or 
challenged in the courts. As a result, officials rarely observed this 
provision. The government sought to reduce the population of prisoners 
in pretrial detention by placing paralegals in some prisons to monitor 
and advise on the cases of pretrial detainees, assist with the drafting 
of appeals, and by directing judges to visit prisons to review and take 
action on pretrial detainee cases.</p>
<p>A December 2019 Supreme Court unanimous decision that police could 
not detain individuals for more than 48 hours without charging them or 
granting bail had little or no effect on authoritiesâ behavior.</p>
<p>The law provides for bail, including those accused of serious crimes,
 but courts often used their unlimited discretion to set bail at 
prohibitively high levels.</p>
<p><u></u>Arbitrary Arrest: There were no specific reports of arbitrary 
arrests by police, although the general practice of holding detainees 
without proper warrant or charge continued (see Arrest Procedures and 
Treatment of Detainees).</p>
<p><u></u>Pretrial Detention: Lengthy pretrial detention remained a 
serious problem. Ghana Prisons Service statistics available in July 2019
 indicated 1,848 prisoners, approximately 12 percent of all prisoners, 
were in pretrial status. The government kept prisoners in extended 
pretrial detention due to police failure to investigate or follow up on 
cases, case files lost when police prosecutors rotated to other duties 
every three years, slow trial proceedings marked by frequent 
adjournments, detaineesâ inability to meet bail conditions that were 
often set extremely high even for minor offenses, and inadequate legal 
representation for criminal defendants. The length of pretrial detention
 exceeded the maximum sentence for the alleged crime in numerous 
instances.</p>
<p>Inadequate recordkeeping contributed to prisoners being held in 
egregiously excessive pretrial detention, a few for up to 10 years. 
Judicial authorities, however, were implementing a case tracking system 
on a trial basis in seven different regions. The system is designed to 
track a case from initial arrest to remand custody in the prisons, to 
prosecution in the courts to incarceration or dismissal. The system is 
envisioned to be used by all judicial and law enforcement participants, 
including police, public defenders, prosecutors, courts, prisons, the 
Legal Aid Commission, the Economic and Organized Crimes Office, and 
NGOs, with the intention of increasing transparency and accountability. 
Some commentators believed the tracking system could be used to press 
for release of remand prisoners held for lengthy periods.</p>
<p><u></u>Detainee<u></u>â<u></u>s Ability to Challenge Lawfulness of D<u></u>e<u></u>tention <u></u>b<u></u>efore
 a Court: The law provides for the right of any person to challenge the 
lawfulness of his or her arrest or detention in court, but lack of legal
 representation for detainees inhibited this right.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>While the constitution and law provide for an independent 
judiciary, it was subject to unlawful influence and corruption. Judicial
 officials reportedly accepted bribes to expedite or postpone cases, 
âloseâ records, or issue favorable rulings for the payer of the bribe.</p>
<p>A judicial complaints unit within the Ministry of Justice headed by a
 retired Supreme Court justice addressed complaints from the public, 
such as unfair treatment by a court or judge, unlawful arrest or 
detention, missing trial dockets, delayed trials and rendering of 
judgments, and bribery of judges. The government generally respected 
court orders.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Trial Procedures</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law provide for the right to a fair 
hearing, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. 
Criminal hearings must be public unless the court orders them closed in 
the interest of public morality, public safety, public order, defense, 
welfare of persons younger than age 18, protection of the private lives 
of persons concerned in the proceedings, and as necessary or expedient 
where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice.</p>
<p>Defendants are presumed innocent and have the right to be informed 
promptly and in detail of charges against them, with free assistance of 
an interpreter as necessary. Defendants have the right to a fair and 
public trial without undue delay, but trials were often delayed. 
Defendants have the right to be present at their trials, be represented 
by an attorney, have adequate time and facilities to prepare their 
defense, present witnesses and evidence, and confront prosecution or 
plaintiff witnesses. Defendants have the right not to be compelled to 
testify or confess guilt, although generally defendants are expected to 
testify if the government presents sufficient preliminary evidence of 
guilt. Defendants have the right to appeal. Authorities generally 
respected these safeguards.</p>
<p>In his statement following his visit in 2018, UN Special Rapporteur 
on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights Philip Alston reported that the 
constitutional right to legal aid was meaningless in the great majority 
of cases because of a lack of institutional will to introduce needed 
far-reaching reforms.</p>
<p>Military personnel are tried separately under the criminal code in a 
military court. Military courts, which provide the same rights as 
civilian courts, are not permitted to try civilians.</p>
<p>Village and other traditional chiefs can mediate local matters and 
enforce customary tribal laws dealing with such matters as divorce, 
child custody, and property disputes. Their authority continued to 
erode, however, because of the growing power of civil institutions, 
including courts and district assemblies.</p>

rights abuses at the Economic Community of West African States Court of 
Justice.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law provide for freedom of expression, 
including for the press, and the government generally respected this 
right.</p>
<p><u></u>Freedom of <u></u>Press and Media, Including Online Media: 
Independent media were active and expressed a wide variety of views 
without restriction.</p>
<p><u></u>Violence and Harassment: There were occasional attacks on 
journalists by members of security forces as well as by unknown 
assailants. The NGO Committee to Protect Journalists reported two 
attacks by security forces on journalists related to reporting on 
COVID-19. On August 12, a soldier kicked and beat Stanley Nii Blewu, a 
reporter for the privately owned TV3, as he and a colleague were 
reporting on a sanitation project in Accra. The soldier also confiscated
 cell phones and a camera from Blewu and his colleague Joseph 
Gold-Alorgbey.</p>
<p>In January a court issued a warrant for the arrest of social media 
commentator Kelvin Taylor, who had made public allegations that a Court 
of Appeals judge was favoring the government. On October 7, police 
arrested David Tamakloe, editor in chief of the <i>Whatsup News</i> 
website, for allegedly publishing false news. Tamakloe had published a 
report alleging pre-election irregularities in the Ashanti Region. 
Authorities released Tamakloe on bail October 8; his case remained 
pending. On December 14, authorities arrested Power FM presenter Oheneba
 Boamah, after inviting him a police station for questioning over 
allegedly threatening and insulting the president. He was held just less
 than 48 hours before being released on bail.</p>
<p>In late 2019 the Ministry of Information launched the Framework for 
Journalist Safety and Responsible Journalism in partnership with civil 
society organizations and law enforcement authorities. The National 
Media Commission, an independent governmental body in charge of setting,
 monitoring, and enforcing standards for media practitioners and 
overseeing state-owned media, was charged with the frameworkâs 
implementation in January.</p>
<p><u></u>National Security: In February the National Communications 
Authority (NCA) suspended the operation of Radio Tongu in the Volta 
Region on the grounds of national security, following complaints that 
the radio station was being used to promote the Western Togoland 
separatist movement. The Media Foundation for West Africa raised 
concerns that the NCA had overreached its mandate by sanctioning the 
station for its content rather than technical infractions.</p>

					<p>The constitution provides for freedom of internal movement, 
foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the government 
generally respected these rights. In a stated effort to curb human 
trafficking, however, the government continued its ban on labor 
recruitment to Gulf countries after continuing reports of abuse endured 
by migrant workers. Media investigations revealed some recruitment 
agencies continued their operations despite the ban.</p>

					<p>The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian offices in 
providing protection and assistance to refugees and asylum seekers.</p>
<p><u></u>Abuse of Migrants, Refugees, and Stateless Persons: 
Gender-based violence remained a problem. According to UNHCR, there were
 continuing incidents of sexual and gender-based violence reported from 
refugee camps. UNHCR worked with Department of Social Welfare personnel 
and Ghana Health Service psychosocial counselors to provide medical, 
psychosocial, security, and legal assistance where necessary in all the 
cases reported. Obstacles to holding perpetrators of sexual and 
gender-based violence accountable for acts conducted in the camps 
included ineffective access to civil and criminal legal counseling for 
victims; poor coordination among the Department of Social Welfare, the 
Legal Aid Commission, and police; and lack of representation for the 
alleged perpetrators and presumed survivors.</p>
<p><u></u>Access to <u></u>Asylum: The law provides for the granting of 
asylum or refugee status, and the government has established a system 
for providing protection to refugees. The law allows rejected asylum 
seekers to appeal and remain in the country until an appeal is 
adjudicated. A four-member appeals committee, appointed by the minister 
of the interior, is responsible for adjudicating the appeals, but the 
process continued to be subject to delays.</p>
<p>There were reports of residents of Burkina Faso (called Burkinabe), 
who fled insecurity, continuing to settle in the Upper West Region and 
registering as asylum seekers. The government continued security checks 
of the Burkinabe before commencing the registration process.</p>
<p><u></u>Employment: Refugees could apply for work permits through the 
same process as other foreigners; however, work permits were generally 
issued only for employment in the formal sector, while the majority of 
refugees worked in the informal sector.</p>
<p><u></u>Durable Solutions: UNHCR assisted in the voluntary 
repatriation of Ivoirian refugees who originally came due to political 
instability at home.</p>
<p>UNHCR and the Ghana Refugee Board continued to work with the Liberian
 government to issue passports to Liberians who seek residency in the 
country, enabling them to receive residence and work permits. UNHCR 
Ghana coordinated with the UNHCR office in Liberia to expedite the 
process. The Ghana Immigration Service also supported the process by 
issuing reduced-cost residency permits, including work permits for 
adults, to locally integrating former Liberian refugees.</p>

					<p>The constitution and law provide citizens the ability to choose 
their government through free and fair periodic elections held by secret
 ballot and based on universal and equal suffrage.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-3__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Elections and Political Participation</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Recent Elections: The law stipulates 10- to 15-year 
sentences for soliciting or engaging in political vigilante activity. 
The government and the two main political parties took steps to rein in 
political vigilante groups, and vigilantism was not a problem in the 
elections. For example, in June the opposition NDC agreed to a Roadmap 
and Code of Conduct designed to eliminate political vigilante activities
 to which the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) had already agreed.</p>
<p>Some opposition parties and civil society organizations reported the 
Electoral Commission (EC) had politicized a voter registration exercise 
that took place June 30 to August 8, particularly in view of the 
presidentâs earlier placing of allegedly biased members on that body. 
The exercise rolled out a new biometric voter registration system built 
for national elections in December. Critics expressed concerns that the 
exercise was hastily organized, confusing, costly, and unnecessary. In 
violent protests involving ruling and opposition party activists at 
several registration locations, two persons died.</p>
<p>Parties and independent candidates campaigned openly and without 
undue restrictions in the period preceding the national elections in 
December for the executive and legislative branches. Participants ran 
largely peaceful campaigns, although there were reports of isolated 
instances of violence such as a clash between political party supporters
 on October 25 in Accra. Just prior to the election in December, the two
 candidates from the largest parties, President Akufo-Addo (NPP) and 
John Mahama (NDC) agreed to a civil society-sponsored âpeace pactâ for 
the electoral cycle.</p>
<p>Domestic and international observers assessed the elections to be 
transparent, inclusive, credible, and reflecting the will of the people.
 Some observers noted concerns over the misuse of incumbency, the lack 
of enforcement of regulations on campaign financing, and unequal access 
granted to state-owned media during the campaign. There were reports of 
six deaths (see section 1.a.) and some reports of postelection violence.</p>
<p>The opposition NDC rejected the ECâs December 9 announced results and
 claimed fraud by both the NPP and the EC in the presidential election 
and at least five parliamentary seats. Media and civil society groups 
generally did not give these claims credence.</p>
<p><u></u>Participation of Women and M<u></u>embers of Minority Groups: 
No laws limit participation of women or members of minority groups in 
the political process, and they did participate, although not in the 
same numbers as men. Three women ran for president, and there was one 
woman vice presidential candidate from one of the two largest parties. 
Women held fewer leadership positions than men, and female political 
figures faced sexism, harassment, and threats of violence. Cultural and 
traditional factors limited womenâs participation in political life. 
Research organizations found that insults, concerns regarding physical 
safety, and overall negative societal attitudes toward female 
politicians hindered women from entering politics.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-4" class="report__section-title">Section 4. Corruption and Lack of Transparency in Government</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for corruption by government
 officials, but the government did not implement the law effectively, 
and officials frequently engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. 
There were numerous reports of government corruption. Corruption was 
present in all branches of government, according to media and NGOs.</p>
<p>The government took steps to implement laws intended to foster more 
transparency and accountability in public affairs. Authorities 
commissioned the Right to Information (RTI) secretariat in July to 
provide support to RTI personnel in the public sector; however, some 
civil society organizations stated the government had not made 
sufficient progress implementing the law.</p>
<p>The country continued use of the national anticorruption online 
reporting dashboard, for the coordination of all anticorruption efforts 
of various governmental bodies.</p>
<p><u></u>Corruption: In June, President Akufo-Addo directed Auditor 
General Daniel Yao Domelevo to take accumulated leave and hand over 
control of the office to his deputy. Domelevo, an outspoken critic of 
corruption, had clashed with officials and pursued prominent corruption 
cases. After Domelevo challenged the constitutionality of the order, the
 president extended the leave. In October a group of nine civil society 
organizations sued the president to safeguard the independence of the 
auditor general office. The Audit Service Board investigated Domelevo 
and in November forwarded a report to the Audit Committee alleging 
irregularities in Domelevoâs foreign travel.</p>
<p>In October, President Akufo-Addo fired the CEO of the Public 
Procurement Authority, who had been shown on videotape in 2019 as having
 conflicts of interest in the award of government contracts. In 
November, Special Prosecutor Martin Amidu resigned, alleging the 
government did not provide adequate resources for his office to execute 
its mandate and complaining that public officials did not cooperate with
 his work, particularly suspected corruption in the Akufo-Addo 
administration connection to Agyapa Limited Royalties. Prior to Amiduâs 
resignation, civil society criticized the structure and positioning of 
the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) under the attorney general, 
suggesting the OSPâs reporting structure meant it could not be fully 
independent. In November the OSP released a report on the Agyapa case, 
its sole report during Amiduâs tenure. Observers expressed frustration 
that the OSP did not investigate more cases.</p>
<p>In November, Special Prosecutor Martin Amidu resigned, alleging the

independent. In November the OSP released a report on the Agyapa case, 
its sole report during Amiduâs tenure. Observers expressed frustration 
that the OSP did not investigate more cases.</p>
<p>According to the governmentâs Economic and Organized Crime Office as 
well as Corruption Watch, a campaign steered by the Ghana Center for 
Democratic Development, the country lost 9.7 billion cedis ($1.9 
billion) to corruption between 2016 and 2018 in five controversial 
government contracts with private entities. In October 2019 the deputy 
commissioner of the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative 
Justice (CHRAJ) stated that 20 percent of the national budget and 30 
percent of all government procurement were lost to corruption annually.</p>
<p><u></u>Financial Disclosure: The constitutionâs code of conduct for 
public officers establishes an income and asset declaration requirement 
for the head of state, ministers, cabinet members, members of 
parliament, and civil servants. All elected and some appointed public 
officials are required to make these declarations every four years and 
before leaving office. The CHRAJ commissioner has authority to 
investigate allegations of noncompliance with the law regarding asset 
declaration and take âsuch action as he considers appropriate.â 
Financial disclosures remain confidential unless requested through a 
court order. Observers criticized the financial disclosure regulation, 
noting that infrequent filing requirements, exclusion of filing 
requirements for family members of public officials, lack of public 
transparency, and absence of consequences for noncompliance undermined 
its effectiveness.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A variety of domestic and international human rights groups 
generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
were often cooperative and responsive to the views of such groups.</p>
<p><u></u>Government Human Rights Bodies: The CHRAJ, which had offices 
across the country, and which mediated and settled cases brought by 
individuals against government agencies or private companies, operated 
with no overt interference from the government; however, since it is 
itself a government institution, some critics questioned its ability 
independently to investigate high-level corruption. Its biggest 
obstacles were low salaries, poor working conditions, and the loss of 
many of its staff to other governmental organizations and NGOs. Public 
confidence in the CHRAJ was high, resulting in an increased workload for
 its staff.</p>
<p>The Police Professional Standards Board also investigated human rights abuses and police misconduct.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">Women</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Rape and Domestic Violence: The law criminalizes rape of 
women but not spousal rape. Sexual assault on a man may be charged as 
indecent assault. Prison sentences for those convicted of rape range 
from five to 25 years, while indecent assault is a misdemeanor subject 
to a minimum term of imprisonment of six months. Domestic violence is 
punishable by a fine or a sentence of up to two years imprisonment. Rape
 and domestic violence remained serious problems. Authorities did not 
enforce the law effectively.</p>
<p>In November the parent-teacher association of a school in the Volta 
Region reported to the police and petitioned the Ghana Education Service
 to investigate allegations of rape and sexual assault against the head 
teacher. The teacher allegedly tried to convince a pregnant student to 
have sex with him and threatened and raped her. Media reported the man 
made sexual advances on six other girls.</p>
<p>The Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU) of the Ghana 
Police Service worked closely with the Department of Social Welfare, the
 Domestic Violence Secretariat, the CHRAJ, the Legal Aid Commission, the
 Ark Foundation, UNICEF, the UN Population Fund, the national chapter of
 the International Federation of Women Lawyers, and several other human 
rights NGOs to address rape and domestic violence. Inadequate logistical
 capacity in the DOVVSU and other agencies, however, including the 
absence of private rooms to speak with victims, hindered the full 
application of the law. Pervasive cultural beliefs in female roles, as 
well as sociocultural norms and stereotypes, posed additional challenges
 to combatting domestic violence. For example, media reported that the 
central regional coordinator for DOVVSU stated that âdenying your spouse
 sex amounted to emotional abuseâ and suggested that men whose wives 
denied them sex could report them to the DOVVSU.</p>
<p>Unless specifically called upon by the DOVVSU, police seldom 
intervened in cases of domestic violence, in part due to a lack of 
counseling skills and shelter facilities to assist victims. Few of the 
cases in which police identified and arrested suspects for rape or 
domestic abuse reached court or resulted in conviction due to witness 
unavailability, inadequate training on investigatory techniques, police 
prosecutor case mismanagement, and, according to the DOVVSU, lack of 
resources on the part of victims and their families to pursue cases. 
Police could refer victims to one NGO-operated designated shelter. In 
cases deemed less severe, victims were returned to their homes; 
otherwise, the DOVVSU contacted NGOs to identify temporary shelters. 
Authorities reported officers occasionally had no alternative but to 
shelter victims in the officersâ own residences until other arrangements
 could be made.</p>
<p>The DOVVSU continued to teach a course on domestic violence case 
management for police officers assigned to the unit. It had one clinical
 psychologist to assist domestic violence victims. The DOVVSU tried to 
reach the public through various social media accounts. The DOVVSU also 
addressed rape through public education efforts on radio and in 
communities, participation in efforts to prevent child marriage and 
sexual and gender-based violence, expansion of its online data 
management system to select police divisional headquarters, and data 
management training.</p>
<p><u></u>Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C): Several laws 
include provisions prohibiting FGM/C. Although rarely performed on adult
 women, the practice remained a serious problem for girls younger than 
age 18 in some regions. According to the Ministry of Gender, Children, 
and Social Protection, FGM/C was significantly higher in the Upper East 
Region with a prevalence rate of 27.8 percent, compared with the 
national rate of 3.8 percent. According to the 2017 to 2018 Multiple 
Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), women in rural areas were subjected to 
FGM/C three times more often than women in urban areas (3.6 percent 
compared with 1.2 percent). Intervention programs were partially 
successful in reducing the prevalence of FGM/C, particularly in the 
northern regions.</p>
<p><u></u>Other <u></u>Harmful Traditional Practices: The constitution 
prohibits practices that dehumanize or are injurious to the physical and
 mental well-being of a person. Media reported several killings and 
attempted killings for ritual purposes. In the Northern, North East, 
Upper East, and Upper West Regions, families or traditional authorities 
banished rural women and men suspected of âwitchcraftâ to âwitch camps.â
 According to a local group, there were six witch camps throughout the 
country, holding approximately 2,000 to 2,500 adult women and 1,000 to 
1,200 children. One camp saw its numbers go down significantly due to 
education, support, and reintegration services provided by the 
Presbyterian Church. The Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social 
Protection has the mandate to monitor witch camps but did not do so 
effectively.</p>
<p>Most of those accused of witchcraft were older women, often widows. 
Some persons suspected to be witches were killed. In July several 
individuals beat to death a woman age 90 suspected of witchcraft in 
Kafaba, in Savannah Region. Government officials denounced the killing, 
and police arrested and charged five individuals for murder.</p>
<p>The law criminalizes harmful mourning rites, but such rites 
continued, and authorities did not prosecute any perpetrators. In the 
north, especially in the Upper West and Upper East Regions, some widows 
were required to undergo certain rites to mourn or show devotion for the
 deceased spouse. The most prevalent widowhood rites included a one-year
 period of mourning, tying ropes and padlocks around the widowâs waist 
or neck, forced sitting by the deceased spouse until burial, solitary 
confinement, forced starvation, shaving the widowâs head, and smearing 
clay on the widowâs body. In the Northern and Volta Regions along the 
border with Togo, wife inheritance, the practice of forcing a widow to 
marry a male relative of her deceased husband, continued.</p>
<p><u></u>Sexual Harassment: No law specifically prohibits sexual 
harassment, although authorities prosecuted some sexual harassment cases
 under provisions of the criminal code.</p>
<p><u></u>Coercion in Population Control: There were no reports of 
coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization on the part of government 
officials.</p>
<p><u></u>Discrimination: The constitution and law provide for the same 
legal status and rights for women as for men under family, labor, 
property, nationality, and inheritance laws. While the government 
generally made efforts to enforce the law, predominantly male tribal 
leaders and chiefs are empowered to regulate land access and usage 
within their tribal areas. Within these areas women were less likely 
than men to receive access rights to large plots of fertile land. Widows
 often faced expulsion from their homes by their deceased husbandâs 
relatives, and they often lacked the awareness or means to defend 
property rights in court.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Children</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Birth Registration: Citizenship is derived by birth in 
the country or outside if either of the childâs parents or one 
grandparent is a citizen. Children unregistered at birth or without 
identification documents may be excluded from accessing education, 
health care, and social security. Although having a birth certificate is
 required to enroll in school, authorities indicated children would not 
be denied access to education on the basis of documentation. According 
to the MICS, birth registration increased with levels of education and 
wealth and was more prevalent in urban centers than in rural areas. 
Authorities adjudicated birth registrations in a nondiscriminatory 
manner.</p>
<p><u></u>Education: The constitution provides for tuition-free, 
compulsory, and universal basic education for all children from 
kindergarten through junior high school. The government continued to 
implement its plan to provide tuition-free enrollment in senior high 
school, including by rolling out a âdouble-trackâ system that helped 
increase enrollment from 800,000 in the 2016-17 school year to 1.2 
million in the 2019-20 school year.</p>
<p>Girls in the northern regions and rural areas throughout the country 
were less likely to continue and complete their education due to the 
weak quality of educational services, inability to pay expenses related 
to schooling, prioritization of boysâ education over girlsâ, security 
problems related to distance between home and school, lack of dormitory 
facilities, and inadequate sanitation and hygiene facilities. In March 
the government shut down all schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 
reopened some school grades in September.</p>
<p><u></u>Child Abuse: The law prohibits sex with a child younger than 
age 16 with or without consent and sexual abuse of minors. There 
continued to be reports of male teachers sexually assaulting and 
harassing both female and male students. Physical abuse and corporal 
punishment of children were concerns. Local social workers rarely were 
able to respond effectively to and monitor cases of child abuse and 
neglect. Media reported several cases of child abuse.</p>
<p><u></u>Child, <u></u>Early<u></u>,<u></u> and Forced Marriage: The 
minimum legal age for marriage for both sexes is 18. The law makes 
forcing a child to marry punishable by a fine, one yearâs imprisonment, 
or both. Early and forced child marriage, while illegal, remained a 
problem, with 34 percent of girls living in the five northern regions of
 the country marrying before the age of 18. According to the MICS, child
 marriage was highest in the Northern, North East, Upper East, Savannah,
 and Volta Regions; it was lowest in the Greater Accra, Ashanti, and 
Ahafo Regions.</p>
<p>The Child Marriage Unit of the Domestic Violence Secretariat of the 
Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Protection continued to lead 
governmental efforts to combat child marriage. The ministry launched the
 first <i>National Strategic Framework on Ending </i><i>Child </i><i>Marriage in Ghana (2017-26)</i>.
 The framework prioritized interventions focused on strengthening 
government capacity to address neglect and abuse of children, girlsâ 
education, adolescent health, and girlsâ empowerment through skills 
development. The National Advisory Committee to End Child Marriage and 
the National Stakeholders Forum, with participation from key government 
and civil society participants, provided strategic guidance and 
supported information sharing and learning on child marriage among 
partners in the country. The Child Marriage Unit also created a manual 
with fact sheets and frequently asked questions, and maintained social 
media accounts to reach wider audiences.</p>
<p><u></u>Sexual Exploitation of Children: The law prohibits commercial 
sexual exploitation of children, although it does not specifically 
mention sale or offering or procurement of children for prostitution. 
Authorities did not effectively enforce the law. The minimum age for 
consensual sex is 16, and participating in sexual activities with anyone
 younger than 16 is punishable by imprisonment for seven to 25 years. 
The law criminalizes the use of a computer to publish, produce, procure,
 or possess child pornography, punishable by imprisonment for up to 10 
years, a substantial fine, or both.</p>
<p><u></u>Infanticide or<u></u> <u></u>Infanticide of Children with 
Disabilities: The law bans infanticide, but several NGOs reported that 
communities in the Upper East Region kill âspirit childrenâ born with 
physical disabilities who are suspected of being possessed by evil 
spirits. Local and traditional government entities cooperated with NGOs 
to raise public awareness concerning causes and treatments for 
disabilities and to rescue children at risk of ritual killing. 
Authorities enforced governing prohibitions on infanticide.</p>
<p><u></u>Displaced Children: The migration of children to urban areas 
continued due to economic hardship in rural areas. Children often had to
 support themselves to survive, contributing to both child sexual 
exploitation and the school dropout rate. Girls were among the most 
vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation while living on the 
streets.</p>
<p><u></u>International Child Abductions: The country is not a party to 
the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs <i>Annual Report on International Parental Abduction</i> at <a class="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210330215207/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data/reported-cases.html" target="_self"> <span class="external-link-title">https://

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Persons with Disabilities</h3>

					
					<p>The law explicitly prohibits discrimination against persons with
 disabilities and protects the rights of persons with disabilitiesâ 
access to health services, information, communications, transportation, 
the judicial system, and other state services, but the government did 
not effectively enforce the law. The law provides that persons with 
disabilities have access to public spaces with âappropriate facilities 
that make the place accessible to and available for use by a person with
 disability,â but inaccessibility to schools and public buildings 
continued to be a problem. Some children with disabilities attended 
specialized schools that focused on their needs. Few adults with 
disabilities had employment opportunities in the formal sector.</p>
<p>In January 2019 the Ghana Federation of Disability Organizations 
reported that women with disabilities faced multifaceted discrimination 
in areas of reproductive health care, and because of the mistreatment, 
they were unwilling in most cases to visit a health facility for medical
 care.</p>
<p>Persons with both mental and physical disabilities, including 
children, were frequently subjected to abuse and intolerance. 
Authorities did not regularly investigate and punish violence and abuses
 against persons with disabilities. Children with disabilities who lived
 at home were sometimes tied to trees or under market stalls and were 
caned regularly; families reportedly killed some of them.</p>
<p>The Ghana Education Service, through its Special Education Unit, 
supported education for children who are deaf or hard of hearing or have
 vision disabilities through 14 national schools for deaf and blind 
students, in addition to one private school for them.</p>
<p>Thousands of persons with mental disabilities, including children as 
young as seven, were sent to spiritual healing centers known as âprayer 
camps,â where mental disability was often considered a âdemonic 
affliction.â Some residents were chained for weeks in these 
environments, denied food for days, and physically assaulted. Officials 
took few steps to implement the law that provides for monitoring of 
prayer camps and bars involuntary or forced treatment. International 
donor funding helped support office space and some operations of the 
Mental Health Authority.</p>

					<p>Municipal authorities closed more than 100 shops owned or 
operated by Nigerian nationals in the Ashanti Region over several 
months, for violation of municipal or commercial regulations prohibiting
 noncitizens from operating certain types of shops. Various Nigerian 
commercial organizations and the Nigerian government complained of these
 closures as mistreatment of their members and citizens and abuse of 
their rights as participants in the Economic Community of West African 
States.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">Acts of Violence, Criminalization, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h3>

					
					<p>The law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity. The law criminalizes the act of 
âunnatural carnal knowledge,â which is defined as âsexual intercourse 
with a person in an unnatural manner or with an animal.â The offense 
covers only persons engaged in same-sex male relationships and those in 
heterosexual relationships. There were no reports of adults prosecuted 
or convicted for consensual same-sex sexual conduct.</p>
<p>Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons 
faced widespread discrimination in education and employment. Following 
his visit to the country in 2018, UN Special Rapporteur Alston noted 
that stigma and discrimination against LGBTI persons made it difficult 
for them to find work and become productive members of the community. 
According to a 2018 survey, approximately 60 percent of citizens 
âstrongly disagreeâ or âdisagreeâ that LGBTI persons deserve equal 
treatment with heterosexuals.</p>
<p>LGBTI persons also faced police harassment and extortion attempts. 
There were reports police were reluctant to investigate claims of 
assault or violence against LGBTI persons. While there were no reported 
cases of police or government violence against LGBTI persons, stigma, 
intimidation, and the negative attitude of police toward LGBTI persons 
were factors in preventing victims from reporting incidents of abuse. 
Gay men in prison were vulnerable to sexual and other physical abuse.</p>
<p>Some activists reported that police attitudes were slowly changing, 
with community members feeling more comfortable with certain police 
officers to whom they could turn for assistance, such as the 
IGP-appointed uniformed liaison officers. Activists also cited improved 
CHRAJ-supported activities, such as awareness raising via social media. 
As one example, the CHRAJ published announcements on an LGBTI dating 
site regarding citizen rights and proper channels to report abuses. 
Activists also stated they noted fewer discriminatory statements from 
public figures.</p>
<p>A coalition of LGBTI-led organizations from throughout the country, 
officially registered in 2018, continued to hold meetings. Its 
objectives included building membersâ capacity, assisting with their 
access to resources and technical support, and fostering networking. 
Activists working to promote LGBTI rights noted great difficulty in 
engaging officials on LGBTI problems because of social and political 
sensitivity. Media coverage regarding homosexuality and related topics 
was almost always negative.</p>
<p>LGBTI activists reported that in June, one LGBTI individual was 
severely beaten in Kasoa in the Central Region. Although police arrested
 the perpetrator, they requested money from the victim to pursue 
prosecution, and the victim eventually dropped the case.</p>
<p>LGBTI activists also reported attempts to blackmail LGBTI individuals
 were widespread and that it remained difficult to attain prosecution 
due to discrimination. For example, in October a gay man reported to 
police his landlordâs collaboration with a blackmailer. The police sided
 with the landlord, forced the victim to unlock his mobile phone, 
âoutedâ the victim to his family, and forced the victimâs family to pay 
money to the landlord.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">HIV and AIDS Social Stigma</h3>

					
					<p>Discrimination against persons with HIV and AIDS remained a 
problem. Fear of stigma surrounding the disease, as well as a fear that 
men getting tested would immediately be labeled as gay, continued to 
discourage persons from getting tested for HIV infection, and many of 
those who tested positive from seeking timely care. HIV-positive persons
 faced discrimination in employment and often were forced to leave their
 jobs or houses. The government and NGOs subsidized many centers that 
provided free HIV testing and treatment for citizens, although high 
patient volume and the physical layout of many clinics often made it 
difficult for the centers to respect confidentiality.</p>
<p>The law penalizes discrimination against a person infected with or 
affected by HIV or AIDS by substantial fines, imprisonment for 18 months
 to three years, or both. The law contains provisions that protect and 
promote the rights and freedoms of persons with HIV or AIDS and those 
suspected of having HIV or AIDS, including the right to health, 
education, insurance benefits, employment, privacy and confidentiality, 
nondisclosure of their HIV/AIDS status without consent, and the right to
 hold a public or political office.</p>
<p>The Ghana AIDS Commission continued to raise concerns regarding how 
high levels of stigma and discrimination contributed to the spread of 
HIV/AIDS in the country.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-9" class="report__section-subtitle">Other Societal Violence or Discrimination</h3>

					
					<p>Chieftaincy disputes, which frequently resulted from lack of a 
clear chain of succession, competing claims over land and other natural 
resources, and internal rivalries and feuds, continued to result in 
deaths, injuries, and destruction of property. According to the West 
Africa Center for Counter Extremism, chieftaincy disputes and ethnic 
violence were the largest sources of insecurity and instability in the 
country. The government generally sought to dampen down violence and 
encourage dialogue and peaceful resolution of disputes.</p>
<p>Disputes continued among Fulani herdsmen as well as between herdsmen 
and landowners that at times led to violence. In a conflict between 
herdsmen in July, a man cut off the hand of a rival who intervened in a 
dispute.</p>
<p>There were frequent reports of killings of suspected criminals in mob
 violence. Community members often saw such vigilantism as justified in 
light of the difficulties and constraints facing judicial and police 
sectors. There were multiple reports police failed to prevent and 
respond to societal violence, in particular incidents of âmob justice.â</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the right of workersâexcept for members of 
the armed forces, police, the Ghana Prisons Service, and other security 
and intelligence agency personnelâto form and join unions of their 
choice without previous authorization or excessive requirements. The law
 requires trade unions or employersâ organizations to obtain a 
certificate of registration and be authorized by the chief labor 
officer, who is an appointed government official. Union leaders reported
 that fees for the annual renewal of trade union registration and 
collective bargaining certificates were exorbitant and possibly legally 
unenforceable.</p>
<p>The law provides for the right to conduct legal strikes but restricts
 that right for workers who provide âessential services.â Workers in 
export-processing zones are not subject to these restrictions. The 
minister of employment and labor relations designated a list of 
essential services, which included many sectors that fell outside of the
 essential services definition set by the International Labor 
Organization (ILO). The list included services carried out by utility 
companies (water, electricity, etc.), ports and harbors, medical 
centers, and the Bank of Ghana. These workers have the right to bargain 
collectively. In these sectors parties to any labor disputes are 
required to resolve their differences within 72 hours. The right to 
strike can also be restricted for workers in private enterprises whose 
services are deemed essential to the survival of the enterprise by a 
union and an employer. A union may call a legal strike only if the 
parties fail to agree to refer the dispute to voluntary arbitration or 
if the dispute remains unresolved at the end of arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p>The law provides a framework for collective bargaining. A union must 
obtain a collective bargaining certificate from the chief labor officer 
in order to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of a class of 
workers. In cases where there are multiple unions in an enterprise, the 
majority or plurality union would receive the certificate but must 
consult with or, where appropriate, invite other unions to participate 
in negotiations. The certificate holder generally includes 
representatives from the smaller unions. Workers in decision-making or 
managerial roles are not provided the right to collective bargaining 
under the law, but they may join unions and enter into labor 
negotiations with their employers.</p>
<p>The National Labor Commission is a government body with the mandate 
of requiring employers and unions to comply with labor law. It also 
serves as a forum for arbitration in labor disputes. The government 
effectively enforced applicable laws but penalties were not commensurate
 with those for other laws involving denials of civil rights, such as 
discrimination.</p>
<p>The law allows unions to conduct their activities without 
interference and provides reinstatement for workers dismissed under 
unfair pretenses. It protects trade union members and their officers 
against discrimination if they organize.</p>
<p>The government generally protected the right to form and join 
independent unions and to conduct legal strikes and bargain 
collectively, and workers exercised these rights. Although the law makes
 specified parties liable for violations, specific penalties are not set
 forth. An employer who resorts to an illegal lockout is required to pay
 the workersâ wages. Some instances of subtle employer interference in 
union activities occurred. Many unions did not follow approved processes
 for dealing with disputes, reportedly due to the perceived unfair and 
one-sided application of the law against the unions. The process was 
often long and cumbersome, with employers generally taking action when 
unions threatened to withdraw their services or declare a strike. The 
National Labor Commission faced obstacles in enforcing applicable 
sanctions against both unions and employers, including limited ability 
to enforce its mandate and insufficient oversight.</p>
<p>Trade unions engaged in collective bargaining for wages and benefits 
with both private and state-owned enterprises without government 
interference. No union completed the dispute resolution process 
involving arbitration, and there were numerous unsanctioned strikes.</p>
<p>Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) workers went on strike in 
October, halting all domestic flights, to protest the damage of 
underground cables at the La wireless station in Accra that allegedly 
threatened flight safety. The union blamed the governmentâs lease of an 
Air Navigation Service plot to a flight-training school and resultant 
construction, despite there being 27 years remaining on the GCAA lease.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor. The 
penalties were not commensurate with those for other analogous serious 
crimes, such as kidnapping. The government did not effectively enforce 
the law. The government increased the level of funding and staffing 
dedicated to combatting human trafficking but did not provide sufficient
 support to enforce the law fully. The government increased its direct 
support for protection services for victims of trafficking by training 
staff and opening and operating a shelter for adult female victims of 
human trafficking during 2019. The government imposed strict prosecution
 provisions and penalties. In July authorities sentenced two individuals
 to 18- and 16-year prison terms for trafficking nine children to work 
in fishing in Lake Volta; police stated the sentences were the longest 
that had been issued. Forced labor and trafficking, however, persisted 
with insufficient investigation and prosecution. NGOs, civil society, 
and human rights activists reported corruption within police ranks, the 
justice system, and political authorities that impeded prosecution, with
 perpetrators accumulating significant wealth from trafficking and 
forced labor and senior police officers intimidating NGO staff to deter 
their investigations.</p>

<p>There were reports of forced labor affecting both children and adults
 in the fishing sector, as well as forced child labor in informal 
mining, agriculture, domestic labor, porterage, begging, herding, 
quarrying, and hawking (see section 7.c.).</p>
<p>Investigations decreased significantly between 2018 and 2019, and 
suspects were prosecuted using laws with less stringent penalties. Legal
 counsel encountered difficulties in investigating trafficking and 
gathering witnesses to testify, especially in cases perpetrated by a 
family member or involving victims from another country. Due to a lack 
of training on trafficking, officers did not classify cases as criminal,
 but issued warnings and freed perpetrators. Police officers who were 
trained were often sidelined for unknown reasons.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The government did not prohibit all of the worst forms of child 
labor. The law sets the minimum employment age at 15, or 13 for light 
work unlikely to be harmful to a child or to affect the childâs 
attendance at school. The law prohibits night work and certain types of 
hazardous labor for those younger than 18 and provides for fines and 
imprisonment for violators. The law allows for children age 15 and older
 to have an apprenticeship under which craftsmen and employers have the 
obligation to provide a safe and healthy work environment along with 
training and tools.</p>
<p>Inspectors from the Ministry of Employment and Labor Relations 
enforced child labor regulations. Labor inspectors conducted inspections
 specifically targeting child labor in the informal sector, but the 
inspections were insufficient to deter child labor, and penalties were 
not commensurate with those for other analogous serious crimes, such as 
kidnapping.</p>
<p>The ILO, government representatives, the Trades Union Congress, 
media, international organizations, and NGOs continued efforts to 
increase institutional capacity to combat child labor.</p>
<p>The government continued to work closely with NGOs, labor unions, and
 the cocoa industry to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in the 
industry. Through these partnerships the government created several 
community projects, which promoted awareness raising, monitoring, and 
livelihood improvement.</p>
<p>In 2018 the government approved the <i>National Plan of Action Phase II on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor</i> (<i>NPA2</i>). The <i>NPA2</i>
 aims to reduce the prevalence of the worst forms of child labor to 10 
percent by 2021, and specifically targets the cocoa, fishing, and mining
 sectors. The government continued to take action under the framework of
 the <i>NPA2</i>. The National Steering Committee on Child Labor, for 
example, carried out a monitoring exercise in seven districts to 
ascertain the impact of child labor. The Ministry of Employment and 
Social Welfare established guidelines for Child Labor Free Zones, and 
began pre-testing the Ghana Child Labor Monitoring System.</p>
<p>Authorities did not enforce child labor laws effectively or 
consistently. Law enforcement officials, including judges, police, and 
labor officials, were sometimes unfamiliar with the provisions of the 
law that protected children.</p>
<p>Employers subjected children as young as four to forced labor in the 
agriculture, fishing, and mining industries, including artisanal gold 
mines, and as domestic laborers, porters, hawkers, and quarry workers. 
NGOs estimated that almost one-half of trafficked children worked in the
 Volta Region. Starting in 2019 civil society organizations rescued more
 than 200 children subjected to forced labor and beatings and denied 
food, education, and safe living conditions at Lake Volta. In the 
fishing industry, they engaged in hazardous work, such as diving into 
deep waters to untangle fishing nets caught on submerged tree roots. The
 government did not legally recognize working underwater as a form of 
hazardous work. Officials from the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture
 Development received training as part of a strategy to combat child 
labor and trafficking in the fisheries sector.</p>
<p>Child labor continued to be prevalent in artisanal mining 
(particularly illegal small-scale mining), fetching firewood, 
bricklaying, food service and cooking, and collecting fares. Children in
 small-scale mining reportedly crushed rocks, dug in deep pits, carried 
heavy loads, operated heavy machinery, sieved stones, and amalgamated 
gold with mercury.</p>
<p>Child labor occurred in cocoa harvesting. Children engaged in cocoa 
harvesting often used sharp tools to clear land and collect cocoa pods, 
carried heavy loads, and were exposed to agrochemicals, including toxic 
pesticides. The government did not legally recognize this type of work 
in agriculture, including in cocoa, as hazardous work for children.</p>
<p>Employers often poorly paid and physically abused child laborers, and
 the children received little or no health care. According to the MICS, 
one in every five children between the ages of five and 17 is engaged in
 hazardous working conditions, and there were no significant disparities
 between boys and girls.</p>
<p>Parents or guardians often facilitated child trafficking by selling 
their children to relatives or others due to poverty. This was 
especially prevalent with girls sold into domestic service. The mother 
of a 12-year-old victim paralyzed from injuries due to forced labor and 
human trafficking refused to report her daughterâs perpetrators to 
police because the persons involved were her in-laws, and she suspected 
police would attempt to collect money from her rather than prosecute.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>The government did not effectively enforce prohibitions on 
discrimination. The law stipulates that an employer cannot discriminate 
against a person on the basis of several categories, including gender, 
race, ethnic origin, religion, social or economic status, or disability,
 whether that person is already employed or seeking employment. 
Penalties were not commensurate with laws related to civil rights, such 
as election interference. Discrimination in employment and occupation 
occurred with respect to women, persons with disabilities, HIV-positive 
persons, and LGBTI persons (see section 6). For example, reports 
indicated few companies offered reasonable accommodation to employees 
with disabilities. Many companies ignored or turned down such 
individuals who applied for jobs. Women in urban centers and those with 
skills and training encountered little overt bias, but resistance 
persisted to women entering nontraditional fields and accessing 
education. There were legal restrictions to womenâs employment in the 
same industries as men, including in factories.</p>
<p>There were not sufficient systems in place to protect women from 
sexual harassment and other violence in the workplace. Employers often 
terminated or laid off women who resisted sexual harassment or violence 
under the guise of restructuring due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>A national tripartite committee composed of representatives of 
the government, labor, and employers set a minimum wage. The minimum 
wage exceeded the governmentâs poverty line. Many companies did not 
comply with the law. The maximum workweek is 40 hours, with a break of 
at least 48 consecutive hours every seven days. Workers are entitled to 
at least 15 working days of leave with full pay in a calendar year of 
continuous service or after having worked at least 200 days in a 
particular year. These provisions, however, did not apply to piece 
workers, domestic workers in private homes, or others working in the 
informal sector. The law does not prescribe overtime rates and does not 
prohibit excessive compulsory overtime. Penalties for violations of 
minimum wage laws were not commensurate with those for similar crimes, 
such as fraud.</p>
<p>The government sets industry-appropriate occupational safety and 
health regulations. By law workers can remove themselves from situations
 that endanger their health or safety without jeopardy to their 
employment. This legislation covers only workers in the formal sector, 
which employed approximately 10 percent of the labor force. Few workers 
felt free to exercise this right. Employers were fined in cases of 
negligence, and penalties for violations of occupational health and 
safety laws were not commensurate with those for crimes such as 
negligence.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Employment and Labor Relations was unable to enforce 
the wage law effectively. The government also did not effectively 
enforce health and safety regulations, which are set by a range of 
agencies in the various industries, including the Food and Drugs 
Authority, Ghana Roads Safety Commission, and Inspectorate Division of 
the Minerals Commission. The law reportedly provided inadequate coverage
 to workers due to its fragmentation and limited scope. There was 
widespread violation of the minimum wage law in the formal economy 
across all sectors. Authorities did not enforce the minimum wage law in 
the informal sector. Legislation governing working hours applies to both
 formal and informal sectors. Employers largely followed the law in the 
formal sector but widely flouted it in the informal sector, and 
government did not enforce it.</p>
<p>Three teachersâ unions engaged in nationwide strikes over nonpayment 
of legacy arrears in December 2019 and in January. The unions reported 
that the Ghana Education Service failed to respond to three letters 
demanding information on their payments from 2012 to 2016. The Fair 
Wages and Salaries Commission also failed to respond to the unionsâ 
request for a meeting to discuss a âcollective agreement.â</p>
<p>The government did not employ sufficient labor inspectors to enforce 
compliance. Inspectors were poorly trained and did not respond to 
violations effectively. Inspectors did have the authority to make 
unannounced inspections. Inspectors did not impose sanctions and were 
unable to provide data as to how many violations they addressed. In most
 cases inspectors gave advisory warnings to employers, with deadlines 
for taking corrective action. Penalties were insufficient to enforce 
compliance.</p>
<p>Approximately 90 percent of the working population was employed in 
the informal sector, according to the Ghana Statistical Serviceâs <i>2015 Labor Force Report</i>,
 including small to medium-scale businesses such as producers, wholesale
 and retail traders, and service providers made up of contributing 
family workers, casual wageworkers, home-based workers, and street 
vendors. Most of these workers were self-employed.</p>
<p>Accidents in the mining sector were common, often in illegal mining. 
In a January 2019 mine explosion 16 persons died, and in October, five 
persons died in the collapse of a pit. Civil society organizations 
stated that corruption and lax enforcement allowed unsafe illegal mining
 practices to continue.</p>
<p>In March 2019 the High Court in Accra ordered a mining company to pay
 more than nine million cedis ($1.7 million) in damages in a case 
concerning the drowning of an employee in 2015. The court found gross 
negligence on the part of the company for failing to meet health and 
safety standards.</p>
