				<hr>
<p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong> The Department of State will release 
an addendum to this report in mid 2021 that expands the subsection on 
Women in Section 6 to include a broader range of issues related to 
reproductive rights.â</p>
<hr>
<p>Romania is a constitutional republic with a democratic, multiparty 
parliamentary system. The bicameral parliament consists of the Senate 
and the Chamber of Deputies, both elected by popular vote. Observers 
considered local elections held on September 27 and parliamentary 
elections held on December 6 to have been generally free and fair and 
without significant irregularities.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs is responsible for the General 
Inspectorate of the Romanian Police, the gendarmerie, border police, the
 General Directorate for Internal Protection, and the Directorate 
General for Anticorruption. The General Directorate for Internal 
Protection has responsibility for intelligence gathering, 
counterintelligence, and preventing and combatting vulnerabilities and 
risks that could seriously disrupt public order or target Ministry of 
Internal Affairs operations. The minister of interior appoints the head 
of the directorate. The Romanian Intelligence Service, the domestic 
security agency, investigates terrorism and national security threats. 
The president nominates and the parliament confirms the serviceâs 
director. Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the 
intelligence service and the security agencies that reported to the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs. Members of the security forces committed 
some abuses.</p>
<p>Significant human rights issues included: cases of cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment by the government; widespread 
official corruption; lack of investigation and accountability for 
violence against women and girls; and crimes of violence targeting 
institutionalized persons with disabilities and members of ethnic 
minority groups.</p>
<p>The judiciary took steps to prosecute and punish officials who 
committed abuses, but authorities did not have effective mechanisms to 
do so and delayed proceedings involving alleged police abuse and 
corruption, with the result that many of the cases ended in acquittals. 
Impunity for perpetrators of some human rights abuses was a continuing 
problem.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports during the year that the government or its
 agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings. There is no agency 
specifically designated to investigate whether police killings were 
justified. Prosecutorâs offices handle investigations and prosecutions 
against police who commit killings while military prosecutorsâ offices 
handle investigations and prosecutions against members of the 
gendarmerie who commit killings.</p>
<p>In July 2019 in the city of Vatra Dornei, three gendarmes tried for 
10 minutes to immobilize physically a 55-year-old man suspected of 
inappropriately touching a child and used tear gas spray against him. 
During the intervention, the man became unconscious and was taken to the
 hospital, where he died the following day. In 2020, the Prosecutorâs 
Office attached to the Iasi Military Tribunal continued the 
investigation of the case, which included the prosecution of a member of
 the gendarmerie for abusive behavior and abuse of power.</p>
<p>In 2017 the trial began of former communist-era Securitate officials 
Marin Parvulescu, Vasile Hodis, and Tudor Postelnicu, accused of crimes 
against humanity before the Bucharest Court of Appeals. They were 
charged in the death of dissident Gheorghe Ursu, who was arrested and 
allegedly beaten to death by investigators and cellmates in 1985. In 
October 2019 the Bucharest Court of Appeals issued a nonfinal ruling 
acquitting Parvulescu and Hodis. Gheorghe Ursuâs son challenged the 
decision before the High Court of Cassation and Justice. As of November 
2020, the High Court of Cassation and Justice had not issued a ruling.</p>
<p>In 2016 the Military Prosecutorâs Office indicted former president 
Ion Iliescu, former Prime Minister Petre Roman, former vice prime 
minister Gelu Voican Voiculescu, and former Intelligence Service 
director Virgil Magureanu for crimes against humanity. They were accused
 of involvement in the 1990 âminersâ riot,â when thousands of miners 
were brought to Bucharest to attack demonstrators opposed to Iliescuâs 
rule. According to official figures, the violence resulted in hundreds 
of injuries, illegal arrests, and four deaths. Media estimates of the 
number of injuries and deaths were much higher. Prosecutors opened the 
preliminary phase of the case before the High Court of Cassation and 
Justice in 2019, but on December 10, the court returned the indictment 
to prosecutors, citing irregularities.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law prohibit such practices, but there were
 reports from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and media that police
 and gendarmes mistreated and abused Roma, primarily with excessive 
force, including beatings. Amnesty International, the European Roma 
Rights Center, the Romani Center for Social Intervention and Studies 
(CRISS), and the Civic Union of Young Roma from Romania reported several
 instances of police abuse against Roma, in the context of enforcing 
movement restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>On April 23, media circulated a video showing the chief of police in 
the town of Bolintin Vale in Giurgiu County beating several Romani 
persons immobilized in handcuffs on the ground and verbally abusing them
 for speaking in the Romani language. Following expressions of public 
outrage, the Ministry of Interior announced it had started an 
investigation of the incident. Human rights NGOs also noted that on 
April 20, the Interior Ministerâs Chief of Staff Traian Berbeceanu 
referred to the allegations of police abuse and stated on social media 
that âviolence must be met with violence.â</p>
<p>In 2019 prosecutors in Bucharest Sector 5 opened a case against 15 
employees and the director of the Rahova Penitentiary Hospital for 
allegedly beating several inmates between 2015 and 2018 and falsifying 
medical records to cover up the abuses. In September 2019 prosecutor 
indicted the employees, and the case remains pending before the 
Bucharest Tribunal.</p>
<p>The NGO CRISS stated that in 44 cases of police brutality against 
Roma over the previous 13 years, there were no convictions at the 
national level, often because prosecutors did not take the cases to 
court. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in several cases 
that the justice system had failed to deliver a just outcome in cases of
 police brutality, particularly against Roma and cases involving abuses 
in psychiatric hospitals. The average time for a ruling in cases of 
alleged police abuse of Roma was nearly four years. In March the ECHR 
issued a ruling on a case involving the 2005 shooting of a 15-year-old 
Romani girl at close range by a police officer at a train depot in 
Chitila. As a result of the shooting, the victim suffered severe wounds 
and required surgery to remove part of her liver. The ECHR noted that 
authorities failed to ensure that physical evidence linked to the 
incident was gathered and preserved. Technical and medical expert 
reports were not produced until several years later, preventing the 
investigating authorities from making conclusive findings. Both the 
Prosecutor attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justice and a 
Bucharest district court dismissed the victimâs complaint in 2014 and 
2015. According to the ECHR, authorities did not make genuine efforts to
 establish the events of the 2005 police operation.</p>
<p>In 2019 a total of 194 complaints against penitentiary staff had been
 lodged with the National Penitentiary Authority (NPA) for abuses of 
inmatesâ rights, acts of discrimination, mistreatment, and inappropriate
 behavior. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), the NPA 
referred 76 complaints submitted by inmates in 2019 to authorities.</p>
<p>Impunity was a significant problem in the security forces, 
particularly among police and gendarmerie. Police officers were 
frequently exonerated in cases of alleged beatings and other cruel, 
inhuman, or degrading treatment. A widespread perception of police 
corruption and inefficiency contributed to citizensâ lack of respect for
 police. Low salaries also contributed to making individual law 
enforcement officials susceptible to bribery. Prosecutors are 
responsible for investigating abuses according to provisions in the 
countryâs criminal legislation. The Directorate for Internal Review 
within the Romanian Police can conduct, under prosecutorial supervision,
 criminal investigations of abuses committed by members of the police as
 well as internal administrative investigations. The government took the
 following steps to increase respect for human rights by the security 
forces: members of the police and gendarmerie were provided briefings on
 a wide range of human rights issues, including a European Court of 
Human Rights decision on police violence against Roma; police schools 
and academies reserved several seats for admission opened only to 
persons of Romani ethnicity; the Ministry of Interior, the police, 
police schools and academies, as well as gendarmerie schools provided 
trainings to students, noncommissioned officers, and officers on a wide 
range of human rights issues, including gender-based violence, racism, 
discrimination, and diversity.</p>
<p>According to the United Nations, three allegations of sexual 
exploitation and abuse by Romanian peacekeepers reported in 2017 and 
2018 were pending. All cases involved military observers deployed in UN 
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. One case 
involved the alleged sexual abuse (rape) of a minor. The peacekeeper in 
question was repatriated by the United Nations. The other two cases 
involved alleged sexual exploitation (transactional sex). Investigations
 by Romanian authorities were pending.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h3>

					
					<p>Prison conditions remained harsh and overcrowded and did not 
meet international standards. The abuse of prisoners by authorities and 
other prisoners reportedly continued to be a problem.</p>
<p><u></u>Physical <u></u>C<u></u>onditions: According to official 
figures, overcrowding was a problem, particularly in those prisons that 
did not meet the standard of 43 square feet per prisoner set by the 
Council of Europe. Conditions remained generally poor within the prison 
system, and observers noted insufficient spending on repair and 
retrofitting. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, men and 
women, juveniles and adults, and pretrial detainees and convicted 
persons were not held together.</p>
<p>Media outlets, NGOs, and the ombudsperson reported that prisoners regularly assaulted and abused fellow inmates.</p>
<p>Several prisons provided insufficient medical care, and inmates 
complained that food quality was poor and sometimes insufficient in 
quantity. According to the MFA, during the year the amount and quality 
of food improved. In some prisons heating and ventilation were 
inadequate. According to the Association for the Defense of Human 
Rights-Helsinki Committee (ADHR-HC), inmates did not have access to 
adequate counseling, and many psychologist and social worker positions 
were not filled. Persons with mental disorders did not receive 
sufficient care and were frequently isolated by other inmates. The 
ADHR-HC stated that the actual number of persons who had mental health 
problems was three times higher than the number of inmates who received 
treatment for mental illness.</p>
<p>In May several inmates set fire to the Satu-Mare Penitentiary, 
resulting in the death of three inmates and the hospitalization of two 
others. Following the incident, the NPA notified authorities and started
 an internal investigation.</p>
<p>The ADHR-HC stated that some pretrial detention facilities had 
inadequate conditions, particularly in terms of hygiene. Such facilities
 were often located in basements and had no natural light and inadequate
 sanitation. In some pretrial facilities and prisons, there was no 
possibility for confidential meetings between detainees and their 
families or attorneys. The ADHR-HC also criticized the lack of HIV and 
hepatitis prevention measures.</p>
<p><u></u>Administration: Inmates have the possibility of filing 
complaints with law enforcement agencies and judges. Independent 
authorities did not always investigate credible allegations of inhuman 
conditions.</p>
<p><u></u>Independent <u></u>Monitoring: The government permitted 
monitoring visits by independent human rights observers, and such visits
 occurred during the year. The ombudsperson also visited prisons as part
 of her mandate to monitor places of confinement.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and 
detention, and the government generally respected these prohibitions. 
The law provides for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness
 of his or her detention.</p>
<p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19, the government hospitalized or 
placed in supervised quarantine tens of thousands of persons between 
March and June based on regulations later deemed unconstitutional. In 
June the Constitutional Court found unconstitutional a 2006 law and an 
emergency ordinance passed during the year that allowed the Health 
Minister to authorize mandatory hospitalization and quarantines in order
 to prevent the spread of epidemics. According to the Constitutional 
Court, mandatory hospitalization and placement in quarantine represented
 deprivations of freedom and the procedures related to these measures 
should have been clear and predictable, included provisions for the 
protection of fundamental rights, and based on law.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>By law only judges may issue detention and search warrants, and 
the government generally respected this provision. Authorities must 
inform detainees at the time of their arrest of the charges against them
 and their legal rights, including the right to remain silent and the 
right to an attorney. Police must notify detainees of their rights in a 
language they understand before obtaining a statement and bring them 
before a court within 24 hours of arrest. Although authorities generally
 respected these requirements, there were some reports of abuses during 
the year. Pending trial, if the alleged offender does not pose any 
danger to conducting the trial, there is no concern of flight or 
commission of another crime, and the case does not present a âreasonable
 suspicionâ that the person would have committed the offense, the 
investigation proceeds with the alleged offender at liberty. Depending 
on the circumstances of the case, the law allows home detention and 
pretrial investigation under judicial supervision, which requires the 
person accused to report regularly to law enforcement officials. A bail 
system also exists but was seldom used. Detainees have the right to 
counsel and, in most cases, had prompt access to a lawyer of their 
choice. Authorities provided indigent detainees legal counsel at public 
expense. The arresting officer is also responsible for contacting the 
detaineeâs lawyer or, alternatively, the local bar association to 
arrange for a lawyer. A detainee has the right to meet privately with 
counsel before the first police interview. A lawyer may be present 
during the interview or interrogation.</p>
<p>The law allows police to take an individual to a police station 
without a warrant for endangering others or disrupting public order. 
Following amendments that entered into force in January, the provision 
that allowed police to hold persons for up to 24 hours was replaced with
 a provision that imposes the obligation to release persons âat once.â 
The ADHR-HC criticized the amendment as leaving room for abuse because 
of the vagueness of the term âat once.â</p>
<p><u></u>Pretrial Detention: A judge may order pretrial detention for 
up to 30 days. A court may extend this period in 30-day increments up to
 a maximum of 180 days. Under the law detainees may hold courts and 
prosecutors liable for unjustifiable, illegal, or abusive measures.</p>
<p>The law allows for home detention using electronic monitoring 
devices, but the government did not procure such devices, and persons 
were placed under home detention without them. A judge may detain a 
person for up to five years during a trial, which is deducted from the 
prison sentence if the person is convicted.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>Lack of sufficient personnel, physical space, and technology to 
enable the judiciary to act swiftly and efficiently continued, resulting
 in excessively long trials.</p>
<p>The constitution provides for an independent judiciary. The Superior 
Council of Magistrates (CSM) is the countryâs judicial governance body 
and is responsible for protecting judicial independence. It generally 
maintained transparency and suspended judges and prosecutors suspected 
of legal violations. In May, the CSM voted against disbanding the 
Section to Investigate Offenses in the Judiciary, an entity that 
judicial and law enforcement stakeholders criticized as having the 
potential to intimidate judges and prosecutors. In July the CSM judgesâ 
section voted for the six-month suspension of a judge from Bihor for 
having given an interview that included her concerns that local 
ânetworks of interestsââjudiciary and business representativesâjoined 
forces to have âinconvenientâ judges like herself removed. Additionally,
 in the case of the dismissal of former National Anticorruption 
Directorate (DNA) Chief Prosecutor Laura Kovesi, the European Court of 
Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that Kovesi was wrongly dismissed from her 
position in 2018, saying that her dismissal infringed on her rights to 
access to a court and freedom of expression. President Iohannis 
responded that the ECHRâs decision places on Romaniaâs Constitutional 
Court the obligation to not only review its decision regarding Kovesiâs 
dismissal, but also any other decisions touching on an individualâs 
public statements.</p>
<p>The government generally respected judicial independence and 
impartiality. Some prosecutors and judges complained to the council that
 media outlets and politiciansâ statements damaged their professional 
reputations.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Trial Procedures</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and the law provide for the right to a fair and
 public trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this 
right.</p>
<p>Under the law defendants enjoy the right to the presumption of 
innocence, have the right to be informed promptly and in detail of the 
charges against them, and have the right to free linguistic 
interpretation, as necessary, from the moment charged through all 
appeals. Trials should take place without undue delay, but delays were 
common due to heavy caseloads or procedural inconsistencies. Defendants 
have the right to be present at trial. The law provides for the right to
 counsel and the right to consult an attorney in a timely manner. The 
law requires that the government provide an attorney to juveniles in 
criminal cases; the Ministry of Justice paid local bar associations to 
provide attorneys to indigent clients. Defendants may confront or 
question witnesses against them (unless the witness is an undercover 
agent) and present witnesses and evidence on their own behalf. The law 
generally provides for the right of defendants and their attorneys to 
view and consult case files, but prosecutors may restrict access to 
evidence for such reasons as protecting the victimâs rights and national
 security. Both prosecutors and defendants have a right of appeal. 
Defendants may not be compelled to testify against themselves and have 
the right to abstain from making statements. Prosecutors may use any 
statements by defendants against them in court.</p>

 Judicial and administrative remedies are available to individuals and 
organizations for abuses of human rights by government agencies. 
Plaintiffs may appeal adverse judgments involving alleged abuses of 
human rights by the state to the ECHR after exhausting the avenues of 
appeal in domestic courts.</p>
<p>Approximately 80 percent of court cases were civil cases. Caseloads 
were distributed unevenly, resulting in vastly different efficiency 
rates in different regions. A lack of both jurisprudence and a modern 
case management system contributed to a high number of appeals as well 
as lengthy trials. Litigants sometimes encountered difficulties 
enforcing civil verdicts because the procedures for enforcing court 
orders were unwieldy and prolonged.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-11" class="report__section-subtitle">Property Restitution</h3>

					
					<p>According to the National Authority for Property Restitution 
(ANRP), the Jewish community is entitled to receive compensation for 
buildings and land that belonged to the Judaic religious denomination or
 legal entities of the Jewish community that were confiscated between 
September 6, 1940, and December 22, 1989. Individuals are entitled to 
compensation only for real estate confiscated between 1945 and 1989. The
 government has laws and mechanisms in place to address Holocaust-era 
property claims.</p>
<p>The law for returning property seized by the former communist and 
fascist regimes includes a âpointsâ system to compensate claimants where
 restitution of the original property is not possible. Claimants may use
 the points to bid in auctions of state-owned property or exchange them 
for monetary compensation. The parliament intended the law to speed up 
restitution, but local authorities hindered property restitution by 
failing to complete a land inventory stipulated by law. The government 
twice extended the deadline for the inventoryâs completion.</p>
<p>There were numerous disputes over church buildings and property that 
the Romanian Orthodox Church failed to return to the Greek Catholic 
Church, despite court orders to do so. The government did not take 
effective action to return churches confiscated by the post-World War II
 communist government. There continued to be lengthy delays in 
processing claims related to properties owned by national minority 
communities. Under the law there is a presumption of abusive transfer 
that applies to restitution of private property but not to religious or 
communal property. In many cases, documents attesting to the abusive 
transfer of such properties to state ownership no longer existed. 
Religious and national minorities are not entitled to compensation for 
nationalized buildings that were demolished.</p>
<p>Associations of former owners asserted that the points compensation 
system was ineffective and criticized the restitution law for failing to
 resolve cases fairly, as well as for lengthy delays and corruption. 
While the pace of resolving restitution cases at the administrative 
level increased, the number of properties returned involving churches 
and national minorities was disproportionately low. The number of cases 
resolved annually has remained approximately constant over the past 
three years, (an average of 1,300), but the number of positive decisions
 remained extremely low. Religious communities disputing these rulings 
continued having to go to court and incur additional costs. As of 
September, there were 4,442 pending requests for restitution from 
religious denominations.</p>
<p>According to advocates of the Romanian Jewish community, the 
disappearance of entire document repositories, combined with limited 
access to other archives, prevented the Jewish community from filing 
certain claims before the legal deadlines. The ANRP rejected most 
restitution claims concerning former Jewish communal properties during 
its administrative procedures. The Caritatea Foundation, established by 
the Federation of Jewish Communities in Romania and World Jewish 
Restitution Organization (WJRO) to claim communal properties, challenged
 these negative ANRP decisions in court. The WJRO also reported that the
 restitution of heirless private Jewish properties was not completed and
 that there was insufficient research concerning property that had 
belonged to Jewish victims of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The Department of Stateâs Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today 
(JUST) Act report to Congress, which covers Holocaust-era restitution, 
was released on July 29 and is available on the Departmentâs website: <a class="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210331102907/https://www.state.gov/reports/just-act-report-to-congress/" target="_self"> <span class="external-link-title">https://www.state.gov/reports/just-act-report-to-congress/</span></a>.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for freedom of expression, including 
for the press, and the government partially respected this right. 
Independent media organizations noted excessive politicization of media,
 corrupt financing mechanisms, as well as editorial policies 
subordinated to the former elected ruling party and ownersâ interests. 
Reporters said their freedom of expression was also limited by 
restricted access to information of public interest issued by the 
previous government and public institutions, including expenses, 
contracts, or bids involving public funds, and officialsâ academic 
records, and pandemic records. Reporters and NGOs often had to sue 
state-controlled ministries, agencies, or local entities to access 
public information.</p>
<p><u></u>Freedom of <u></u>Speech: The law prohibits Holocaust denial 
and promoting or using symbols representing fascist, racist, xenophobic 
ideologies, or symbols associated with the interwar nationalist, 
extremist, fascist and anti-Semitic Legionnaire movement. Various 
government bodies, mainly the gendarmerie, continued to fine, place 
under temporary arrest, or block individuals who protested in the 
streets for differing causes.</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie fined several individuals who attended an August 10 
protest in Victoria Square to commemorate the victims of the 
Gendarmerieâs violent intervention against pro-rule-of-law protesters on
 August 10, 2018. Those fined included reporter Mircea Savin of 
Podul.ro.</p>
<p><u></u>Freedom of <u></u>Press <u></u>and Media<u></u>, Including 
Online Media: While independent media were active and expressed a wide 
variety of views without overt restriction, politicians or persons with 
close ties to politicians and political groups either owned or 
indirectly controlled numerous media outlets at the national and local 
levels. The news and editorial stance of these outlets frequently 
reflected their ownersâ views and targeted criticism at political 
opponents and other media organizations.</p>
<p>On March 4, the High Court of Justice ruled against an appeal by 
Vrancea County Council President Marian Oprisan (PSD) against reporter 
Sebastian Oancea of Vrancea24 who wrote about public contracts granted 
by Oprisan to his business associates and individuals with criminal 
records. It was the fourth case lost by Oprisan against Oancea in recent
 years.</p>
<p>In March the government ordered prefects and public health 
authorities to ban the publication of county-level information on the 
number of COVID-19 tests performed and number of infections. On March 
20, 14 civic associations issued a joint statement protesting the move, 
and on April 6, almost 100 news outlets and 165 journalists from 
national and local organizations signed a freedom of information request
 initiated by the Center for Independent Journalism asking for fair and 
timely access to COVID-19 information. Due to media and NGO protests, in
 April the government created a Strategic Communications Task Force to 
manage messaging during the pandemic. It also expanded its daily reports
 to include county-level breakdowns.</p>
<p><u></u>Violence and Harassment: Some reporters throughout the country
 continued to be harassed, sued, or threatened by authorities they 
investigated or by their proxies.</p>
<p>In February reporters Alex Costache of TVR and Cosmin Savu of ProTV 
were followed, filmed, and intimidated by six individuals before, 
during, and after the two met with a military prosecutor and a judge at a
 private event in a restaurant. Footage of the four was disseminated on 
February 21 by outlets controlled by oligarchs and media owners facing 
criminal chargers, under investigation, or previously arrested for 
fraud. Military prosecutors opened an investigation into the illegal 
surveillance and filming. In April, Prosecutor General Gabriela Scutea 
dismissed the evidence gathered by military prosecutors, claiming the 
prosecutors lacked jurisdiction.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Internet Freedom</h3>

					
					<p>The government did not systematically restrict or disrupt access
 to the internet or censor online content, and there were no credible 
reports that the government monitored private online communications 
without appropriate legal authority.</p>
<p>On March 16, President Klaus Iohannis signed an emergency decree that
 included provisions to counter the spread of disinformation related to 
COVID-19 online and allowed for the removal of reports and entire 
websites deemed to be spreading false information; the decree provided 
no appeal or redress mechanisms. The National Authority for Management 
and Regulation in Communications, an institution for communication 
infrastructure with no expertise in media content, was given 
responsibility for implementing the decree. In response, on March 30 the
 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)âs 
Representative on Freedom of the Media issued a press release urging 
authorities to restore the capacity of journalists to act in the public 
interest, without undue restriction and to respect the principles of 
necessity and proportionality in any decision related to the emergency 
situation. The European Federation of Journalists also urged President 
Iohannis and the Government of Romania to revise emergency policies 
restricting reportersâ access to information regarding the spread of 
COVID-19 and the regulations giving authorities the power to shut down 
websites. The government suspended 15 websites.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">Academic Freedom and Cultural Events</h3>

					
					<p>On June 16, the Senate adopted an Education Law amendment 
banning schools and universities from discussing gender identity. The 
vote generated numerous protests from associations of university 
rectors, professors, doctors, psychologists, and cultural figures, who 
the amendment violated academic and cultural freedoms as well as the 
right to a science-based education. President Iohannis challenged the 
amendment at the Constitutional Court, arguing the amendment violated 
the constitution. On December 16, the Constitutional Court declared the 
amendment unconstitutional.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Freedoms of Peaceful Assembly and Association</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law provide for the freedom of association,
 but the government occasionally restricted freedom of peaceful 
assembly.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Freedom of Peaceful Assembly</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for freedom of peaceful assembly, 
which the government has generally respected. The law provides that 
unarmed citizens may assemble peacefully but also stipulates that 
meetings must not interfere with other economic or social activities and
 may not take place near such locations as hospitals, airports, or 
military installations. In most cases organizers of public assemblies 
must request permits in writing three days in advance from the mayorâs 
office of the locality where the gathering is to occur.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that public gatherings, including 
protests, must be declared in advance when they are to be held in 
markets, public spaces, or in the vicinity of institutions âof public or
 private interest.â The decision was mandatory. Activists opposed these 
restrictions, stating that by announcing the protests, those who take to
 the streets would be forced to take responsibility not only for 
themselves, but also for larger groups or for instigators to violence 
who may be brought there to compromise peaceful anticorruption protests.</p>
<p>In 2018 a protest at Victoria Square in Bucharest attracted 
approximately 100,000 protesters. Gendarmes used tear gas and water 
cannon indiscriminately, harming peaceful protesters, some of whom were 
children or elderly. More than 770 criminal complaints concerning 
violent incidents that allegedly constituted excessive force against 
peaceful protesters were submitted to authorities. During the year, the 
Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) 
announced it was suspending investigations of four senior officials in 
relation to the protest and that investigations of rank-and-file 
gendarmes accused of excessive violence would continue under the 
coordination of military prosecutors. Following public outcry, DIICOT 
reinstated charges of abuse of office and abusive conduct against the 
senior officials and submitted its decision to the preliminary chamber 
of the Bucharest Court of Appeal for confirmation. The Bucharest Court 
of Appeal declined its jurisdiction and sent the case to the Bucharest 
Tribunal which, as of November, had not made a decision.</p>
<p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19, between March and September the 
government maintained a ban on public gatherings. On September 15, the 
government introduced regulations that allowed public gatherings of a 
maximum of 100 persons. Observers and several NGOs including the Civil 
Liberties Union for Europe and the Greenpeace European Unit noted that 
the government maintained the ban on public gatherings while allowing 
other types of events, such as concerts, to have up to 500 participants.</p>

					<p>The constitution and law provide for the freedom of internal 
movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the 
government generally respected these rights.</p>
<p><u></u>In-country Movement: The internal movement of beneficiaries of
 international protection and stateless persons was generally not 
restricted. Asylum seekers may be subject to measures limiting their 
freedom of movement and to detention in specific circumstances. The law 
and implementing regulations provide that the General Inspectorate for 
Immigration may designate a specific place of residence for an applicant
 for asylum while authorities determine his or her eligibility, or may 
take restrictive measures, subject to approval by the prosecutorâs 
office, that amount to administrative detention in âspecially arranged 
closed areas.â According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), as of October no such cases of asylum detention were 
recorded during the year. Applicants who do not qualify for asylum are 
treated as aliens without a right to stay in the country and may be 
taken into custody pending deportation. According to the law, those 
applying for asylum while in public custody were released from detention
 if granted access to the ordinary procedure. Detention in public 
custody centers is subject to regular review and should not exceed six 
months unless there are specific circumstances, in which case detention 
may be extended for up to 18 months. Applicants for or beneficiaries of 
international protection in certain circumstances, particularly those 
declared âundesirableâ for reasons of national security, may be subject 
to administrative detention in public custody centers.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-10" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Protection of Refugees</h3>

					
					<p>The government cooperated with UNHCR and other humanitarian 
organizations in providing protection and assistance to refugees, asylum
 seekers, stateless persons, and other persons of concern, which could 
include irregular migrants potentially in need of international 
protection.</p>
<p><u></u>Abuse of Migrants, Refugees, and Stateless Persons: According 
to UNHCR, several incidents of harassment, discrimination, and crimes 
against refugees and migrants were reported throughout the year 
throughout the country, although most incidents were not reported 
because of fear, lack of information, inadequate support services, and 
inefficient redress mechanisms.</p>
<p><u></u>Refoulement: The law establishes exceptions to the principle 
of nonrefoulement and the withdrawal of the right to stay following a 
declaration of a person as âundesirable.â This may occur, for example, 
when classified information or âwell founded indicationsâ suggest that 
aliens (including applicants for asylum, or persons granted asylum) 
intend to commit terrorist acts or favor terrorism. Applicants for 
protection declared âundesirableâ on national security grounds were 
taken into custody pending the finalization of their asylum procedure 
and then deported.</p>
<p><u></u>Access to Asylum: The law provides access to asylum procedures
 to foreign nationals and stateless persons who express their desire for
 protection, which may be in the form of refugee status or temporary 
âsubsidiary protectionâ status. The law prohibits the expulsion, 
extradition, or forced return of any asylum seeker at the countryâs 
border or from within the countryâs territory, but this was not without 
exceptions, particularly in cases that fell under the countryâs national
 security and terrorism laws.</p>
<p>The law also refers to the concept of a safe third country. The law 
extends to irregular migrants who transited and were offered protection 
in a third country considered safe or who had the opportunity at the 
border or on the soil of a safe third country to contact authorities for
 the purpose of obtaining protection. In such cases authorities could 
deny access to asylum procedures if the designated safe third country 
agreed to readmit the applicant to its territory and grant access to 
asylum procedures. According to the MFA, the government has not rejected
 any application for protection on a safe third country basis.</p>
<p><u></u>Freedom of <u></u>M<u></u>ovement: The law incorporates four 
ârestrictiveâ measures under which the internal movement of applicants 
for asylum may be limited. The first two establish an obligation to 
report regularly to the General Inspectorate for Immigration or to 
reside at a regional reception center. A third restrictive measure 
allows authorities to place applicants in âspecially arranged closed 
areasâ for a maximum of 60 days, either to access the asylum procedure 
or if the asylum seeker is deemed to pose a danger to national security.
 There was no case of an asylum applicant being placed in a specially 
arranged closed area through August. Authorities may also place asylum 
applicants in administrative detention in a public custody center if 
they are subject to a transfer to another EU member state under the 
Dublin Regulations or if they have been declared âundesirableâ for 
reasons of national security, pending their removal from the country.</p>
<p>According to UNHCR, irregular migrants, persons declared as 
âundesirable,â asylum seekers deemed to pose a ârisk of absconding,â as 
well as other categories of foreigners may face detention in public 
custody centers or in closed areas inside reception centers. Under 
provisions of the law to limit âabuse to the asylum procedure,â 
irregular migrants who submitted their first application for 
international protection while in custody were released from detention 
only if granted access to the ordinary asylum application procedure. The
 provisions raised concerns among UN agencies and civil society due to 
the ambiguity in the phrases âabuse of the asylum procedureâ and ârisk 
of absconding.â</p>
<p>The period of detention in a public custody center could be prolonged up to a maximum of 18 months.</p>
<p><u></u>Employment: While persons granted international protection 
have the legal right to work, job scarcity, low wages, lack of language 
proficiency, and lack of recognized academic degrees and other 
certifications often resulted in unemployment or employment without a 
legal contract and its related benefits and protections. Obtaining a 
legal work contract remained difficult for various reasons, including 
tax concerns and the reluctance of employers to hire refugees.</p>
<p><u></u>Access to Basic Services: Effective access by persons with 
refugee status or subsidiary protection to education, housing, lifelong 
learning and employment, public health care, and social security varied 
across the country, depending on the level of awareness of various 
public and private actors responsible for ensuring access to these 
services.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries of international protection continued to face problems 
with local integration, including access to vocational training adapted 
to their specific needs, counseling programs, and naturalization. 
According to UNHCR, refugee integration programs relied almost 
exclusively on NGOs, with coordination from the General Inspectorate for
 Immigration. The support services or targeted integration and inclusion
 programs provided by local governments to refugees were limited. Access
 to education was problematic, and several school inspectorates refused 
to organize Romanian language classes. According to several reports, 
schools across the country, including in large cities such as Bucharest,
 delayed enrollment of refugee children in school for several months.</p>
<p><u></u>Temporary Protection: The government may grant âtolerated 
statusâ to persons who do not meet the requirements for refugee status 
or subsidiary protection, but who cannot be returned for various 
reasons. These reasons include cases where stateless persons are not 
accepted by their former country of habitual residence or where the 
lives or well-being of returnees could be at risk. Persons with 
âtolerated statusâ have the right to work but not to benefit from any 
other social protection or inclusion provisions, and the government 
restricted their freedom of movement to a specific region of the 
country.</p>
<p>Recipients of subsidiary protection complained of problems regarding 
their freedom of movement to other countries due to the additional visa 
requirements. UNHCR reported that refugees saw citizenship acquisition 
as a cumbersome, costly, and difficult process, with some requirements, 
particularly related to the applicantâs financial situation, that were 
difficult to meet.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-11" class="report__section-subtitle">g. Stateless Persons</h3>

					
					<p>According to the MFA, as of July there were 275 stateless 
persons with valid residence documents in the country. These included 
legal residents under the aliensâ regime, stateless persons of Romanian 
origin, as well as persons granted some form of international 
protection. Data on stateless persons, including on persons at risk of 
statelessness and persons of undetermined nationality, were not reliable
 due to the absence of a procedure to determine statelessness, the 
absence of a single designated authority responsible for this purpose, 
and the lack of adequate identification and registration of persons with
 unknown or undetermined nationality.</p>
<p>The law includes favorable provisions for stateless persons of 
Romanian origin to reacquire citizenship. Nevertheless, a significant 
gap persisted due to the lack of safeguards against statelessness for 
children born in the country, who would be stateless because their 
parents either were themselves stateless or were foreigners unable to 
transmit their nationality.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-3__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Elections and Political Participation</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Recent <u></u>Elections: The country held local elections
 on September 27 and parliamentary elections on December 6 that were 
considered free and fair and without significant irregularities. In 2016
 the country held parliamentary elections that election observers also 
considered free and fair.</p>
<p><u></u>Political Parties<u></u> and Political Participation: The law 
requires political parties to register with the Bucharest Tribunal and 
to submit their statutes, program, and a roster of at least three 
members. Critics asserted that certain requirements undermine the 
freedom of association. These include the requirement that parties field
 candidatesâby themselves or in allianceâin at least 75 electoral 
constituencies in two successive local elections, or that they field a 
full slate of candidates in at least one county or partial slates of 
candidates in a minimum of three counties in two successive 
parliamentary elections. A partyâs statutes and program must not include
 ideas that incite war; discrimination; hatred of a national, racist, or
 religious nature; or territorial separatism.</p>
<p><u></u>Participation of Women and <u></u>Members of <u></u>Minorit<u></u>y
 Groups: No laws limit participation of women or members of minority 
groups in the political process, and they did participate. A report by 
local NGO Expert Forum found that the number of female candidates in the
 September local elections increased to 22.9 percent from 21.4 percent 
in the 2016 local elections. Societal attitudes presented a significant 
barrier, and women remained underrepresented in positions of authority. 
As of January 1, there were 61 women in the 330-seat Chamber of Deputies
 and 25 women in the 136-seat Senate.</p>
<p>Under the constitution each recognized ethnic minority is entitled to
 a representative in the Chamber of Deputies. An organization is 
required, however, to receive votes equal to 5 percent of the national 
average number of votes cast by district for a deputy to be elected. The
 list of organizations that benefit from these provisions is limited to 
those that are already part of a National Council of Minorities, which 
consists of organizations already in parliament. The law sets more 
stringent requirements for minority organizations without a presence in 
parliament. To participate in elections, such organizations must provide
 the Central Electoral Bureau a membership list equal to at least 15 
percent of the total number of persons belonging to that ethnic group, 
as determined by the most recent census. If this number amounts to more 
than 20,000 persons, the organization must submit a list with at least 
20,000 names distributed among a minimum of 15 counties plus the city of
 Bucharest, with no fewer than 300 persons from each county. Some 
organizations and individuals, particularly Romani activists, claimed 
this rule was discriminatory.</p>
<p>Ethnic Hungarians, represented by the Democratic Union of Hungarians 
in Romania political party, were the sole ethnic minority to gain 
parliamentary representation by surpassing the 5 percent threshold of 
all valid votes cast nationally, the threshold set for political 
parties. One Romani organization, Roma Party-Pro Europe, had a single 
representative in parliament.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-4" class="report__section-title">Section 4. Corruption and Lack of Transparency in Government</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for corruption by officials.
 Nevertheless, corrupt practices remained widespread despite several 
high-profile prosecutions. There were numerous reports of government 
corruption during the year.</p>
<p>According to expert opinion, corruption remained a problem. Bribery 
was common in the public sector. Laws were not always implemented 
effectively, and officials sometimes engaged in corrupt practices with 
impunity.</p>
<p><u></u>Corruption: The DNA continued to investigate and prosecute 
corruption cases involving political and administrative officials 
throughout the year. In April the DNA indicted former PSD Health 
Minister and hospital manager Sorina Pintea for taking bribes.</p>
<p>Verdicts in corruption cases were often inconsistent, with sentences 
varying widely for similar offenses. Enforcement of court procedures 
lagged mostly due to procedural and administrative problems, especially 
with respect to asset forfeiture.</p>
<p>Corruption was widespread in public procurement. A 2016 law provides 
for a comprehensive software mechanism to flag potential conflicts of 
interest in public procurement. Bribery was common in the public sector,
 especially in health care. Individual executive agencies were slow in 
enforcing sanctions, and agenciesâ own inspection bodies were generally 
inactive. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the DNA launched several 
investigations into procurement fraud related to purchasing personal 
protective equipment and ventilators. These investigations continued.</p>
<p><u></u>Financial Disclosure: The law empowers the National Integrity 
Agency (ANI) to administer and audit financial disclosure statements for
 all public officials and to monitor conflicts of interest. The law 
stipulates that the agency may identify âsignificant discrepanciesâ 
between an officialâs income and assets, defined as more than 45,000 lei
 ($10,600), and allows for seizure and forfeiture of unjustified assets.
 The mechanism for confiscation of âunjustified assetsâ was cumbersome. 
Through September 18, ANI identified four cases of âsignificant 
discrepanciesâ totaling 3 million lei ($707,000). Through September 18, 
ANI identified 58 cases of incompatibilities, 19 cases of conflicts of 
interest, and eight cases with strong indications of criminal or 
corruption offenses. During the year ANI reviewed 13,268 public 
procurement procedures and issued seven integrity warnings.</p>

					<p>A number of domestic and international human rights groups 
generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
generally met with human rights NGOs and were cooperative and sometimes 
responsive to their views.</p>
<p>In March 2019 the National Center for Mental Health and Antidrug 
Fight, a governmental agency overseen by the Ministry of Health, revoked
 an authorization allowing the Center for Legal Resources (CLR) to visit
 psychiatric wards. As of November, the CLR was not allowed visits to 
psychiatric wards. The CLR is an NGO that reports on alleged abuse of 
institutionalized persons with disabilities.</p>
<p><u></u>Government Human Rights Bodies: The Office of the Ombudsperson
 has limited power and no authority to protect citizensâ constitutional 
rights in cases requiring judicial action. The ombudsperson is the 
national preventive mechanism implementing the optional protocol to the 
UN Convention against Torture. This gives the ombudsperson the power to 
conduct monitoring visits to places where individuals are deprived of 
their liberty, including prisons, psychiatric hospitals, and asylum 
centers. As of September the ombudsperson issued 164 recommendations to 
penitentiaries, schools, local governments, and governmental agencies.</p>
<p>In 2017, the government established the Office of the Childrenâs 
Ombudsperson empowered to examine human rights complaints made by 
children or their legal representatives. In 2016, parliament established
 the Council for Monitoring the Implementation of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The council was authorized to make 
unannounced visits in centers and hospitals for persons with 
disabilities to check if the rights of these persons were respected, 
issue recommendations, and submit criminal complaints. As of September 
the council had issued five reports during the year with recommendations
 based on visits to residential centers for persons with disabilities, 
including improved training for staff and facility renovations. 
Observers reported the councilâs recommendations and reports were 
inaccurate and noted that conditions had not improved. Human rights 
activists and media regarded the institution as ineffective and believed
 that the inspectors who drafted the reports lacked the necessary human 
rights expertise.</p>
<p>Each chamber of parliament has a human rights committee tasked with drafting reports on bills pertaining to human rights.</p>
<p>The National Council for Combating Discrimination (CNCD) is the 
government agency responsible for applying domestic and EU 
antidiscrimination laws. The CNCD reports to parliament. The CNCD 
operated with the governmentâs cooperation and, for the most part, 
without government or party interference. Observers generally regarded 
the CNCD as effective, but some criticized it for a lack of efficiency 
and political independence.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">Women</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Rape and Domestic Violence: Rape, including spousal rape,
 is illegal. The law provides for five to 10 yearsâ imprisonment for 
rape and two to seven yearsâ imprisonment for sexual assault. If there 
are no aggravating circumstances and the attack did not lead to death, 
police and prosecutors may not pursue a case on their own, but they 
require a victimâs complaint, even if there is independent physical 
evidence.</p>
<p>The law classifies family violence as a separate offense and 
stipulates that when murder, battery, or other serious violence is 
committed against a family member, the penalty is increased. The law 
also states that, if the parties reconcile, criminal liability is 
removed. Amendments to the law on equal opportunities for men and women 
passed during the year include cyberviolence among the forms of domestic
 violence and defines it as the occurrence of online harassment, online 
messages that incite to hate based on gender criteria, or the 
nonconsensual publication of private graphic content that aim to 
humiliate, scare, threaten or reduce victims to silence. The FILIA 
Center for Gender Studies and Curriculum Developmentâan NGO that aims to
 promote gender equalityâstated that there were no regulations to 
implement these amendments.</p>
<p>Violence against women, including spousal abuse, continued to be a 
serious problem that the government did not effectively address. The law
 provides for the issuance of provisional restraining orders by police 
for a maximum of five days and restraining orders by a court for a 
maximum of six months upon the victimâs request or at the request of a 
prosecutor, the state representative in charge of protecting victims of 
family violence, or, if the victim agrees, a social service provider. 
Violation of a restraining order is punishable by imprisonment for six 
months to five years, but the FILIA center stated that some judges may 
issue lesser sentences because of overlapping legislation. The court may
 also order an abuser to undergo psychological counselling. The FILIA 
Center stated that police lacked procedures for the implementation and 
monitoring of restraining orders.</p>
<p>In February, a man under a restraining order killed his wife in the 
town of Chitila. According to the FILIA Center, the man had violated the
 restraining order multiple times, a fact which police were aware of, 
and the woman had asked social services to provide her a secure place to
 live in order to prevent her husband from contacting her. Regulations 
authorize local governments to establish emergency mobile intervention 
teams that assist victims of domestic violence. Observers stated that 
teams lacked training and funding and were often ineffective. The FILIA 
Center conducted a study that revealed that most local governments of 
cities and villages in Bacau County did not fund any social services for
 victims of domestic violence, a situation that was common throughout 
the country.</p>
<p>Several human rights activists reported that some police officers 
tried to dissuade victims of rape from pressing charges against their 
aggressors and, in some cases, refused to register criminal complaints 
submitted by victims. In some instances, police delayed action against 
sexual abusers. E-Romnja, an NGO that works to advance the rights of 
Romani women, stated police often discouraged Romani women and girls 
from filing complaints. E-Romnja described the case of a 14-year-old 
girl who reported a rape to police in April and continued to report the 
case for six months. Police opened an investigation but did not question
 the suspect and failed to protect the victim from repeated harassment 
by the suspect and his family. Following several interventions from the 
victimâs lawyer and E-Romnja, police forwarded the case to the 
Prosecutorâs Office and the suspect was placed in pretrial detention in 
September.</p>
<p>Courts prosecuted very few cases of domestic abuse. Many cases were 
resolved before or during trial when the alleged victims dropped their 
charges or reconciled with the alleged abuser.</p>
<p><u></u>Sexual Harassment: Criminal law prohibits sexual harassment, 
which it defines as repeatedly asking for sexual favors in a work or 
similar relationship. A victimâs complaint is necessary to initiate a 
criminal investigation. Penalties range from fines to imprisonment of 
three months to one year. The law on equal opportunities for men and 
women defines sexual harassment as the occurrence of unwanted behavior 
with a sexual connotation, which can be expressed physically, verbally, 
or nonverbally and has the effect or result of damaging a personâs 
dignity and, in particular, the creation of a hostile, intimidating, 
degrading, humiliating, or offensive environment.</p>
<p><u></u>Coercion in Population Control: There were no reports of 
coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization on the part of government 
authorities.</p>
<p><u></u>Discrimination: Under the law women and men enjoy equal 
rights. Women experienced discrimination in marriage, divorce, child 
custody, employment, credit, pay, owning or managing businesses or 
property, education, the judicial process, and housing. The law requires
 equal pay for equal work, but there was a 3.5-percent gender pay gap 
according to EU data. Segregation by profession existed, with women 
overrepresented in lower-paying jobs. There were reports of 
discrimination in employment. Women experienced discrimination in access
 to pension benefits and retirement (see section 7.d.).</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Children</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Birth <u></u>R<u></u>egistration: Children derive 
citizenship by birth from at least one citizen parent. Although birth 
registration is mandatory by law, it was not universal, and authorities 
denied some children public services as a result. Most unregistered 
children had access to schools, and authorities assisted in obtaining 
birth documents for unregistered children, but the education of 
unregistered children depended on the decision of school authorities. 
The law provides simplified birth registration for children whose 
mothers do not have proper documentation to register their children.</p>
<p><u></u>Child Abuse: Child abuse, including emotional, physical, and 
psychological violence and neglect, continued to be serious problems. 
Media outlets reported several severe cases of abuse or neglect in 
family homes, foster care, and child welfare institutions. The 
government has not established a mechanism to identify and treat abused 
and neglected children and their families.</p>
<p><u></u>Child, <u></u>Early<u></u>,<u></u> and <u></u>Forced <u></u>Marriage:
 The legal age of marriage is 18 for both men and women, but the law 
permits minors as young as 16 to marry under certain circumstances. 
Illegal child marriage was reportedly common in certain social groups, 
particularly among some Romani communities. NGOs reported cases of 
Romani girls as young as 11 being sold into marriage by their families. 
Child protection authorities and police did not always intervene in such
 cases. There were no public policies to discourage child marriage.</p>
<p><u></u>Sexual Exploitation of Children: The law provides one- to 
12-year prison sentences for persons convicted of sexual acts with 
minors, depending on the circumstances and the childâs age. Sexual 
intercourse with a minor who is 14 to 16 years of age is punishable by a
 one- to five-year prison sentence. Sexual intercourse with a person 
younger than 14 is punishable by a two- to nine-year prison sentence and
 deprivation of some rights. The law also criminalizes sexual corruption
 of minors (which includes subjecting minors to sexual acts other than 
intercourse or forcing minors to perform such acts), luring minors for 
sexual purposes or child prostitution, and trafficking in minors. 
Pimping and pandering that involve minors increases sentences by 
one-half. The law allows authorities to maintain a registry of 
individuals who had committed sexual offenses against or exploited 
adults and children.</p>
<p>Child pornography is a separate offense and carries a sentence, 
depending on the circumstances, of up to seven yearsâ imprisonment, 
which may be increased by one-third if the perpetrator was a family 
member or someone in whose care the child was entrusted or if the life 
of the child victim was endangered.</p>
<p><u></u>Institutionalized Children: During the year there were several
 media reports of abuses in placement centers for institutionalized 
children, including sexual abuse, physical violence by colleagues or 
staff, and trafficking in persons. Numerous reports noted a lack of 
adequate food, clothing, medical treatment, and counselling services.</p>
<p>According to media reports and NGOs, in 2018 psychiatrists 
administered psychotropic drugs to thousands of children in residential 
institutions or in foster care in order to control their behavior. 
According to official estimates, one-third of the institutionalized 
children, including those with disruptive behavior, attention-deficit, 
or hyperactivity disorder, were under psychotropic medication, but 
observers believed the number to be much higher.</p>
<p>By law unaccompanied migrant children are held in placement centers, 
where they have access to education and benefits other children receive.
 The detention of families with children is allowed by law, with 
preservation of family unity used as justification. Several such cases 
were recorded during the year.</p>
<p><u></u>International Child Abductions: The country is a party to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs <i>Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction</i> at <a class="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210331102907/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data/reported-cases.html" target="_self"> <span class="external-link-title">travel.state.gov/

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">Anti-Semitism</h3>

					
					<p>According to the 2011 census, the Jewish population numbered 
3,271. Representatives of the Jewish community stated that according to 
their estimates, the Jewish population numbered approximately 7,000. 
Acts of anti-Semitism occurred during the year.</p>
<p>The law prohibits public denial of the Holocaust and fascist, racist,
 anti-Semitic, and xenophobic language and symbols, including 
organizations and symbols associated with the indigenous Legionnaire 
interwar fascist movement. The oppression of Roma as well as Jews is 
included in the definition of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Streets, organizations, schools, or libraries continued to be named 
after persons convicted for war crimes or crimes against humanity, 
according to the Elie Wiesel Institute for the Study of the Holocaust in
 Romania. For example, Radu Gyr was a commander and anti-Semitic 
ideologist of the fascist Legionnaire movement convicted of war crimes. 
The Wiesel Institute requested the renaming of Radu Gyr Street in 
Cluj-Napoca. As of September, the local government had not changed the 
name of the street.</p>
<p>Material promoting anti-Semitic views and glorifying legionnaires 
appeared on the internet. According to a study released by the Wiesel 
Institute in May, several articles published online claimed that Jews or
 the state of Israel were responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak and were
 profiting from the health crisis.</p>
<p>In September media reported a case of anti-Semitic messages painted 
on the fence belonging to the relative of a mayoral candidate from the 
village of Dornesti in Suceava County. The messages included the 
candidateâs name, a swastika, and the Romanian equivalent of the ethnic 
slur âkikeâ.</p>
<p>In April 2019 media outlets reported a case of vandalism at a Jewish 
cemetery in Husi, where unknown individuals destroyed dozens of 
headstones. Law enforcement officials identified three suspects, and as 
of September the investigation was pending.</p>
<p>Romania introduced mandatory Holocaust education in 1998 and additional courses are sometimes offered. The high school course <i>History of the Jews</i><i>â</i><i>T</i><i>he Holocaust</i> was optional. During the 2019-20 school year, 3,209 pupils took the course.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Persons with Disabilities</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, 
sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities. The government did not 
fully implement the law, and discrimination against persons with 
disabilities remained a problem.</p>
<p>The law mandates that buildings and public transportation be 
accessible for persons with disabilities, however, streets, buildings, 
and public transportation remain largely inaccessible. Persons with 
disabilities reported a lack of access ramps, accessible public 
transportation, and accessible toilets in major buildings.</p>
<p>Discrimination against children with disabilities in education was a 
widespread problem due to lack of adequate teacher training on inclusion
 of children with disabilities and lack of investment to make schools 
accessible. Most children with disabilities were either placed in 
separate schools or not placed in school at all. According to a report 
released by Save the Children Romania and the Ombudsperson in 2019, only
 30 percent of schools had access ramps for persons with motor 
disabilities and only 15 percent of schools had accessible toilets.</p>
<p>The CLR identified a series of problems in centers for persons with 
disabilities or psychiatric sections, including verbal and physical 
abuse of children and adults, sedation, excessive use of physical 
restraints, lack of hygiene, inadequate living conditions, and lack of 
adequate medical care. In February the CLR released the conclusions of a
 visit made at a residential center for persons with disabilities 
located in the city of Husi, Vaslui County. According to the CLR, there 
were reasonable suspicions that the residents of the center were 
subjected to physical punishment and verbal abuse. The NGO also 
discovered unsanitary living conditions, overcrowding, and lack of basic
 personal hygiene products. According to the MFA, following a report 
published by CLR, the Prosecutorâs Office attached to the High Court of 
Cassation and Justice requested the Prosecutorâs Office attached to the 
HuÈi First Instance Court to examine the alleged abuses in order to 
establish whether there are elements that would warrant a criminal 
investigation concerning the conditions in the residential center.</p>
<p>The National Authority for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
Children and Adoptions under the Labor Ministry coordinated services for
 persons with disabilities and drafted policies, strategies, and 
standards in the field of disabilities rights. The National Authority 
notified authorities about several alleged abuses against persons with 
disabilities interned in residential centers. In January the National 
Authorityâs Director, Madalina Turza, announced it had notified 
prosecutors about the case of a resident of a center in Prahova County 
who, according to the centerâs staff, accidentally fell and suffered 
head injuries. The staff did not call the ambulance right away and sent 
the person to the hospital only two days after the alleged accident. 
Doctors found evidence of repeated brain injuries and performed a 
surgery. One month after the surgery, the person was sent back to the 
center while in a coma where another resident allegedly unintentionally 
removed a medical tube attached to the patient. The centerâs staff 
called an ambulance but several days later the patient died.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Members of National/Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups</h3>

					
					<p>Discrimination against Roma continued to be a problem. Romani 
groups complained that there were instances of police harassment and 
brutality, including beatings. Both domestic and international media and
 observers reported societal discrimination against Roma. NGOs reported 
Roma were denied access to, or refused service in, some public places. 
Roma also experienced poor access to government services, a shortage of 
employment opportunities, high rates of school attrition, and inadequate
 health care. A lack of identity documents excluded many Roma from 
participating in elections, receiving social benefits, accessing health 
insurance, securing property documents, and participating in the labor 
market. According to the Ministry of Interior, 177,816 persons older 
than age 14 did not have valid identity documents. Romani rights 
activists reported that most of these persons were Roma who cannot 
acquire legal identity documents because they resided in informal 
settlements and housing. Roma had a higher unemployment rate and a lower
 life expectancy than non-Roma. Negative stereotypes and discriminatory 
language regarding Roma were widespread.</p>
<p>In July the âImpreunaâ Agency for Community Development released the 
results of a poll that showed seven in 10 residents of the country do 
not trust Roma and that 41 percent of respondents did not accept the 
idea of living in the same city or village with Roma. In March and 
April, several local government officials publicly claimed cited Roma in
 particular spread COVID-19, stoking anti-Romani sentiment. Throughout 
March and April, media outlets regularly alleged that Roma disobeyed 
COVID-19 stay-at-home measures. News stories specifically highlighting 
Romani migrants returning to the country from Italy and Spain, countries
 with high rates of COVID-19 infection, also circulated in local media 
outlets and social media, often suggesting they might be carriers of 
COVID-19.</p>
<p>Despite an order by the Ministry of Education forbidding segregation 
of Romani students, several NGOs continued to report that segregation 
along ethnic lines persisted in schools.</p>
<p>Researchers and activists reported a significant number of the 
remaining Romani Holocaust survivors who applied for a pension were 
denied because of unreasonable administrative barriers raised by the 
pension offices, problematic standards, lack of knowledge about the 
Holocaust and Roma, and burdensome requirements. According to 
researchers, despite historical evidence, in hundreds of cases 
authorities considered that Roma were resettled and not deported, and 
consequently granted them smaller pensions.</p>
<p>In April 2019 the driver of a minibus operated by a transportation 
company in the city of Zalau denied a Romani woman and her two children 
access to the vehicle and hit her repeatedly with a wooden stick. After 
she called the 112 emergency line to report the incident, the operator 
insulted the victim and used racial slurs against her. According to 
Romani CRISS, the attack was racially motivated. The Civic Union of 
Young Roma from Romania reported that prosecutors indicted the driver 
for abusive behavior and the Romani woman for public disturbance. The 
NGO reported that the indictment against the woman was abusive because 
her screams were a result of the driverâs violent behavior. As of 
November the case was pending before the Zalau court.</p>
<p>Ethnic Hungarians continued to report discrimination related mainly 
to the use of the Hungarian language. Ethnic Hungarians reported that 
the government did not enforce the law that states that ethnic 
minorities are entitled to interact with local governments in their 
native language in localities where a minority constitutes at least 20 
percent of the population. There were continued reports that local 
authorities did not enforce the law that states that in localities where
 a minority constitutes at least 20 percent of the population, road 
signs must be bilingual.</p>
<p>The Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania reported that in a 
legal dispute between separated parents over their childâs language of 
schooling, the Cluj-Napoca Court decided in June that the child, who has
 a mixed Romanian-Hungarian ethnicity, should be schooled at the 
kindergarten in Romanian, contrary to the will of the childâs ethnic 
Hungarian mother. According to the court, an insufficient knowledge of 
Romanian would damage the childâs ability to perform well once they 
become a university student considering that most universities in the 
country offer study programs in Romanian. According to the Department 
for Interethnic Relations, throughout the March 16-May 14 state of 
emergency, the government provided Hungarian translations of the state 
of emergency regulations related to the COVID-19 outbreak with a delay. 
In several counties with a significant ethnic Hungarian population, 
government agencies such as public health directorates or police 
inspectorates did not provide information on COVID-19-related measures 
and precautions in Hungarian. The Miko Imre Legal Service reported that 
during a soccer match in March that took place in the city of Ploiesti, 
supporters of the home team shouted offensive words against the rival 
team Sepsi OSK, which is based in the ethnic-Hungarian majority city of 
Sfantu Gheorghe. Supporters chanted âHungarians out of the country!â and
 threw objects at some of the Sepsi OSK players, which caused the 
referee to suspend the match for 10 minutes. In February unknown persons
 painted the Romanian flag over the Hungarian name of Baia Mare city 
that was displayed on several welcome signs.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">Acts of Violence, Criminalization, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
NGOs reported that societal discrimination against lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons was common, and 
there were some reports of violence against them. On some occasions 
police condoned violence against LGBTI persons. The NGO ACCEPT reported 
that in 2019 a person living near their headquarters continuously 
verbally harassed LGBTI persons who visited the NGO and its employees, 
and destroyed the property of a transgender woman. In June 2019 ACCEPT 
submitted a criminal complaint, but as of November, police had not taken
 any measures. ACCEPT reported that in the meantime the harassment 
stopped after the perpetrator moved out.</p>
<p>A survey carried out by the EUâs Fundamental Rights Agency reported 
revealed that 15 percent of respondents experienced a physical or sexual
 attack motivated by the victimâs sexual orientation or gender identity 
during the past five years. Out of respondents who described the most 
recent physical or sexual attack, only 4 percent reported the incidents 
to authorities because they are LGBTI. As many as 28 percent of 
respondents indicated fear of a homophobic reaction, transphobic 
reaction, or both from police as the reason for not reporting a physical
 or sexual attack.</p>
<p>The law governing legal gender recognition for transgender persons 
was vague and incomplete. In some cases, authorities refused legal 
gender recognition unless an individual had first undergone sex 
reassignment surgery. Access to adequate psychological services was also
 limited because some psychologists refused to accept transgender 
patients.</p>

					<p>Although the law provides that HIV-infected persons have the 
right to confidentiality and adequate treatment, authorities rarely 
enforced it. Authorities did not adopt regulations that were necessary 
to provide confidentiality and fair treatment, and discrimination 
against persons with HIV/AIDS impeded their access to routine medical 
and dental care.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the rights of workers to form and join 
independent labor unions, bargain collectively, and conduct legal 
strikes. Unions can affiliate with regional, national, or EU union 
federations, but they may affiliate with only one national organization.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination and allows workers fired for
 union activity to challenge their dismissal in court for reinstatement.
 The law provides for protection of freedom of association and 
collective bargaining, but unions complained there was little 
enforcement to protect against violations of these rights.</p>
<p>Civil servants generally have the right to establish and join unions.
 Employees of the Ministry of National Defense, certain categories of 
civilian employees of the Ministries of Interior and Justice, judges, 
prosecutors, intelligence personnel, and senior public servants, 
including the president, parliamentarians, mayors, prime minister, 
ministers, employees involved in security-related activities, and 
president of the Supreme Court, however, do not have the right to 
unionize. Unions complained about the requirement to submit lists of 
union members with their registration application. Since employers also 
had access to the list, union officials feared this could lead to 
reprisals against individual unionized employees, particularly 
dismissals, and hinder the formation of new unions.</p>
<p>The law requires employers with more than 21 employees to negotiate a
 collective labor agreement but provides no basis for national 
collective labor agreements. Employers refusing to initiate negotiation 
of a collective bargaining agreement can receive fines. The law permits,
 but does not impose, collective labor agreements for groups of 
employers or sectors of activity. The law requires employers to consult 
with unions on such topics as imposing leave without pay or reducing the
 workweek due to economic reasons.</p>
<p>Unions may strike only if they give employers 48 hoursâ notice, and 
employers can challenge the right in court, effectively suspending a 
strike for months. Although not compulsory, unions and employers can 
seek arbitration and mediation from the Labor Ministryâs Office for 
Mediation and Arbitration. Unions criticized the Labor Ministry for 
failing to intervene effectively in cases involving arbitration and 
mediation efforts.</p>
<p>Companies may claim damages from strike organizers if a court deems a
 strike illegal. The law permits strikes only in defense of workersâ 
economic, social, and professional interests and not for the 
modification or change of a law. As a result, workers may not challenge 
any condition of work established by law, such as salaries for public 
servants, limiting the effectiveness of unions in the public sector.</p>
<p>Unions complained that the legal requirement for representativeness, 
which states that the right to collective bargaining and to strike can 
be asserted only by a union that represents 50 percent plus one of the 
workers in an enterprise, was overly burdensome and limited the rights 
of workers to participate in collective bargaining and to strike. In the
 absence of this clear majority, an employer can appoint a worker 
representative of its choosing to negotiate agreements. It is common for
 companies to create separate legal entities to which they then transfer
 employees, thereby preventing them from reaching the necessary 
threshold for representation.</p>
<p>Unions complained about the governmentâs general prohibition on union
 engagement in political activities, intended to prevent unofficial 
agreements to support political parties, due to past abuses by union 
officials.</p>
<p>Official reports of incidents of antiunion discrimination remained 
minimal. It is difficult to prove legally that employers laid off 
employees in retaliation for union activities. The government did not 
effectively enforce the law, however, penalties were commensurate with 
those for similar violations when enforcement was successful. The 
National Council for Combating Discrimination (CNCD) fines employers for
 antiunion discrimination, although it lacks the power to order 
reinstatement or other penalties, and employees usually must seek a 
court order to obtain reinstatement. The law prohibits public 
authorities, employers, or organizations from interfering, limiting, or 
preventing unions from organizing, developing internal regulations, and 
selecting representatives.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor. 
Nevertheless, there were reports that such practices continued to occur,
 often involving Romani, persons with disabilities, and children. The 
government did not effectively enforce the law and took limited measures
 to prevent forced or compulsory labor. The law criminalizes forced 
labor, and penalties for violations were commensurate with those of 
other serious crimes, such as kidnapping, but were not evenly applied in
 all sectors.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 16.5 percent of human 
trafficking victims officially identified in 2019 were exploited 
specifically for labor purposes. In June organized crime investigators 
detained five individuals on charges of modern slavery. The individuals 
were accused of having kidnapped and detained several persons with a

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits the worst forms of child labor. The minimum 
age for most forms of employment is 16. Children may work with the 
consent of parents or guardians at age 15 if the activities do not 
endanger their health, morality, or safety. The law prohibits persons 
younger than 18 from working in hazardous conditions, includes a list of
 dangerous jobs, and specifies penalties for offenders. Some examples of
 hazardous jobs for children include those posing a high risk of 
accident or damage to health, exposure to psychological or sexual risk, 
night shifts, exposure to harmful temperatures, and those requiring use 
of hazardous equipment. Parents whose children carry out hazardous 
activities are required to attend parental education programs or 
counseling and may be fined if they fail to do so.</p>
<p>Minors who work have the right to continue their education, and the 
law obliges employers to assist in this regard. Minors between the ages 
of 15 and 18 may work a maximum of six hours per day and no more than 30
 hours per week, provided their school attendance is not affected. 
Businesses that impose tasks incommensurate with minorsâ physical 
abilities or fail to respect restrictions on minorsâ working hours can 
face fines. Many minors reportedly did not attend school while working. 
Minors have the right to an additional three days of annual leave.</p>
<p>The law requires schools to notify social services immediately if 
children miss class to work, but schools often did not comply. Social 
welfare services have the responsibility to reintegrate such children 
into the educational system.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection may impose fines and 
close businesses where it finds exploitation of child labor. The 
National Authority for the Protection of the Rights of the Child and 
Adoption (ANPDCA) in the Labor Ministry has responsibility for 
investigating reports of child labor abuse, but enforcement of child 
labor laws tended to be lax, especially in rural areas with many 
agricultural households and where social welfare services lacked 
personnel and capacity to address child labor violations. The ANPDCA is 
responsible for monitoring and coordinating all programs for the 
prevention and elimination of child labor.</p>
<p>The government did not effectively enforce the law. Resources were 
inadequate, but penalties were commensurate with those for other serious
 crimes like kidnapping. Government efforts focused on reacting to 
reported cases, and ANPDCA dedicates limited resources to prevention 
programs. According to ANPDCA, 389 children were subject to child labor 
in 2019 and incidents of child labor are widely believed to be much 
higher than official statistics. Child labor, including begging, selling
 trinkets on the street, and washing windshields, remain widespread in 
Romani communities, especially in urban areas. Children as young as five
 frequently engaged in such activities but were frequently underreported
 because official statistics are limited to cases documented by police. 
Children whose parents worked abroad remain vulnerable to neglect and 
abuse. Of the 389 documented cases of child labor in 2019, authorities 
prosecuted alleged perpetrators in 20 cases, while an additional 200 
cases remained under investigation at the end of 2019. Between January 
and June, 115 child labor abuse cases were investigated; out of these, 
78 were closed, 52 were still in progress, and criminal investigations 
were started in three cases.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>Labor laws and regulations prohibit discrimination with respect 
to employment and occupation because of race, sex, gender, age, 
religion, disability, language, sexual orientation or gender identity, 
HIV-positive or other communicable disease status, social status, or 
refugee or stateless status. The government did not enforce these laws 
effectively, reacting to claims of discrimination rather than adequately
 engaging in programs to prevent discrimination. Penalties for 
violations were in general commensurate with those for other types of 
discrimination, but were insufficient to deter violations.</p>
<p>Discrimination in employment or occupation occurred with respect to 
gender, disability, and HIV status. Discrimination against Romani and 
migrant workers also occurred. The CNCD investigated employment 
discrimination cases in both the public and private sectors. During the 
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, media reported several cases of medical 
staff being discriminated against by neighbors and denied access to 
local shops. Following media reports, there was a wave of public support
 for the medical staff in question.</p>
<p>The law mandates equal remuneration for work of equal value. Eurostat
 reports the pay gap between men and women in the country was 3 percent 
in 2018. While the law provides female employees re-entering the 
workforce after maternity leave the right to return to their previous or
 a similar job, pregnant women and other women of childbearing age still
 suffer unacknowledged discrimination in the labor market.</p>
<p>Systemic integration of persons with disabilities does not exist. 
Public bias against persons with disabilities persisted. NGOs have been 
working actively to change attitudes and assist persons with 
disabilities to gain skills and gainful employment, but the government 
lacks adequate programs to prevent discrimination. The law requires 
companies or institutions with more than 50 employees to employ workers 
with disabilities for at least 4 percent of their workforce or pay a 
fine for lack of compliance, which many companies chose to do. Before 
this provision was introduced in 2017, the law allowed companies not in 
compliance with the quota to fulfill their legal obligation by buying 
products from NGOs or firms, known as âsheltered units,â where large 
numbers of persons with disabilities were employed. NGOs reported that 
sheltered units lost an important source of income as a result. On 
November 9, the government re-established âshelteredâ or âprotected 
unitsâ, enterprises that employ at least three persons with disabilities
 who represent at least 30 percent of the overall staff and contribute 
at least 50 percent of the cumulated full time work hours. Local labor 
offices had limited success in facilitating employment for persons with 
disabilities.</p>
<p>NGOs reported that patients suffering from cancer and tuberculosis 
faced discrimination in the workplace. In 2019 almost one-third of 
employees with cancer reported they postponed informing their employer 
of their illness until after treatment, and 17 percent reported a 
substantial reduction in job duties and responsibilities upon returning 
to work. The law supports tuberculosis patients by providing monthly 
food allowances, medical leave, and psychological support but does not 
contain measures to protect patients from workplace discrimination.</p>
<p>As authorities allow greater numbers of non-EU citizens to live and 
work in the country, reports of discrimination against migrant workers 
have become more prevalent. Local residents in Ditrau commune (Harghita 
County) protested after a local bakery hired two Sri Lankan employees. 
The two employees were given other jobs and relocated due to opposition 
to their presence in the village. Another group of Sri Lankan clothing 
factory workers was stranded in Bucharest following a COVID-19 outbreak 
and labor dispute that ended with their employer unilaterally 
terminating their employment contracts and abandoning the group of 
workers outside of the main airport in Bucharest, even though there were
 no flights. To resolve this issue, the Labor Force Agency and the 
General Inspectorate for Migration signed a joint protocol to allow 
non-EU workers to find employment elsewhere in Romania if their 
contracts expire to prevent repeat cases. In another case, the Labor 
Inspectorate launched an investigation after media reported on poor 
working conditions and accommodations for Indian construction workers 
following a COVID-19 outbreak at a building site in Bucharest.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for a national minimum wage that is greater 
than the official estimate for the poverty income level and has nearly 
tripled in nominal terms since 2012. Approximately 42 percent of 
employees earn the minimum wage according to the labor ministry. Despite
 minimum wage increases, nearly one in seven employed Romanians remains 
at risk of poverty.</p>
<p>The law provides for a standard workweek of 40 hours or five days. 
Workers are entitled to overtime pay for weekend or holiday work or work
 of more than 40 hours. An employeeâs workweek may not exceed 48 hours 
per week on average over a four-month reference period, although 
exceptions are allowed for certain sectors or professions. The law 
requires a 48-hour rest period in the workweek, although most workers 
received two days off per week. During reductions in workplace activity 
for economic or technical reasons, the law allows employers to shorten 
an employeeâs workweek and reduce the associated salary.</p>
<p>In response to COVID-19 restrictions, the government extended the 
category of eligible furlough (technical unemployment) benefits to 
independently registered businesspersons, lawyers, and individuals with 
income deriving from copyright and sports activities. Starting in August
 the government adopted a flexible work plan modeled after Germanyâs <i>Kurzarbeit</i>
 (flexible work) program, applicable until December 31, with the aim of 
retaining employees on payrolls with joint government and employer 
contributions. The plan required employers to cover half of full-time 
wages and the Government of Romania to pay 75 percent of the difference 
between the gross wage and the basic wage paid to the employee based on 
the number of hours actually worked. As part of the same package, 
independent and seasonal workers affected by the epidemic could continue
 to receive 41.5 percent of the average gross wages for a limited period
 while day workers and SME employees also would be able to receive 
separate, limited payments to cover wages and teleworking equipment. 
Kurzarbeit and technical unemployment support was extended until June 
2021.</p>
<p>Excessive overtime may lead to fines for employers if workers file a 
complaint, but complaints are rare. The law prohibits compulsory 
overtime. Starting during the year, the law allows for one of two 
caretakers of children to receive paid days off for periods when schools
 are closed; the income is capped at maximum 75 percent of the average 
economy wage.</p>
<p>The law gives employers wide discretion regarding performance-based 
evaluations of employees. The law permits 90-day probationary periods 
for new employees and simplifies termination procedures during this 
period.</p>
<p>The law provides for temporary and seasonal work and sets penalties 
for work performed without a labor contract in either the formal or the 
informal economy. In accordance with EU regulations, the maximum 
duration of a temporary contract is 36 months.</p>
<p>The labor ministry, through the Labor Inspectorate, is responsible 
for enforcing the law on working conditions, health and safety, hours, 
and minimum wage rates, but it did not effectively enforce all aspects 
consistently. Penalties for violations of these laws were commensurate 
with those of other similar crimes, but were not consistently applied. 
Labor inspectors have the authority to make unannounced visits and 
initiate sanctions, but the number of inspectors was insufficient to 
enforce compliance in all sectors. The construction, agriculture, and 
small manufacturers sectors were particularly problematic sectors for 
both labor underreporting and neglecting health and safety standards.</p>
<p>According to trade union reports, many employers paid supplemental 
salaries under the table to reduce tax burdens for employees and 
employers alike. To address underreported labor, in 2017 the government 
increased the minimum required payroll taxes that employers must pay for
 their part-time employees to equal those of a full-time employee 
earning minimum wage. Additionally, the Labor Inspectorate collaborated 
with the National Authority for Fiscal Administration to conduct joint 
operations to check employers in sectors prone to underreported labor, 
including the textile, construction, security, cleaning, food 
preparation, transportation, and storage industries. These 
investigations often focused on underpayment of taxes rather than 
workersâ rights.</p>
<p>The government did not effectively enforce overtime standards. Union 
leaders complained that overtime violations were the main problem facing
 their members, since employers often required employees to work longer 
than the legal maximum without receiving mandatory overtime 
compensation. This practice was especially prevalent in the textile, 
banking and finance, and construction sectors.</p>
<p>In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, additional risk bonuses were
 awarded to healthcare staff caring for COVID-19 patients or for those 
involved in pandemic response. Health sector unions and media 
highlighted cases in which medical staff had limited access to 
protective equipment. In Suceava county, lack of protective equipment 
and lapses in protocol led to a disproportionate outbreak among medical 
staff, prompting the government to implement a range of oversight and 
lockdown measures to contain and control the outbreak, including placing
 Suceavaâs County Emergency Hospital under military management.</p>
