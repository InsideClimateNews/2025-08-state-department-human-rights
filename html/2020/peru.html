				<hr>
<p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong> The Department of State will release 
an addendum to this report in mid 2021 that expands the subsection on 
Women in Section 6 to include a broader range of issues related to 
reproductive rights.</p>
<hr>
<p>Peru is a constitutional, multiparty republic. President Martin 
Vizcarra assumed the presidency in 2018 following the resignation of 
then president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, under whom Vizcarra was vice 
president, on corruption allegations. Kuczynski had won the 2016 
national elections in a vote widely considered free and fair. Using a 
provision of the constitution, President Vizcarra dissolved Congress in 
September 2019 and called for new legislative elections. Free and fair 
legislative elections took place on January 26 to complete the 2016-21 
legislative term, as mandated by the constitution. On November 9, 
Congress impeached President Vizcarra for alleged corruption, under the 
âpermanent moral incapacityâ clause of the constitution. President of 
Congress Manuel Merino assumed the presidency on November 10 due to the 
lack of vice presidents but resigned on November 15 following a week of 
widespread protests. Congress then elected Francisco Sagasti as its new 
president on November 16, and he consequently became president of the 
republic.</p>
<p>The Peruvian National Police, who report to the Ministry of Interior,
 maintain internal security. The armed forces, reporting to the Ministry
 of Defense, are responsible for external security but also have some 
domestic security responsibilities in exceptional circumstances, such as
 the COVID-19 national state of emergency declared in March, and in 
designated emergency areas. Civilian authorities maintained effective 
control over the security forces. Members of the security forces were 
accused of committing abuses during protests this year, particularly 
during November 10-15 protests following the impeachment of former 
president Vizcarra.</p>
<p>Significant human rights issues included: arbitrary detentions 
(including of minors); serious government corruption at all levels, 
including in the judiciary; and sex and labor trafficking.</p>
<p>The government took steps to investigate and in some cases prosecute 
or otherwise punish public officials accused of abuses, including 
high-level officials. Nonetheless, corruption and perception of impunity
 remained prevalent and were a major concern in public opinion. 
President Sagasti publicly committed to support the investigation and 
prosecution of those responsible for abuses during the November 10-15 
protests. The Public Ministry, which is the autonomous public 
prosecutorâs office, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
are also assessing the events of November 10-15.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were widespread allegations that Peruvian National Police 
(PNP) members committed arbitrary or unlawful killings during 
demonstrations following the impeachment of former president Vizcarra. 
Confirmed victims during the November 14 protest were Inti Sotelo and 
Brian Pintado. As of December the Public Ministry was investigating the 
two deaths.</p>
<p>In February courts confirmed a 2019 order for 36 months of pretrial 
detention for former PNP commander Raul Prado Ravines, accused of 
leading a killing squad. The case involved the alleged killing of more 
than 27 criminal suspects during at least nine separate police 
operations from 2012 to 2015 to cover up police corruption and to 
generate awards and promotions. For their roles in the operations, 14 
police officers were in preventive detention (eight in prison and six 
under house arrest) awaiting trial. As of September Prado Ravinesâs 
location was unknown.</p>
<p>The Shining Path domestic terrorist group conducted five separate 
terrorist attacks against military patrols that killed five security 
force members and two civilians and wounded 12 soldiers in the Valley of
 the Apurimac, Mantaro, and Ene Rivers (VRAEM).</p>
<p>Human rights and environmental activists expressed concern for their 
own safety while working in areas with widespread natural resource 
extraction, which often included illegal logging and mining. Activists 
alleged local authorities and other actors engaging in these activities 
harassed the activists, especially in areas where officials faced 
corruption charges and suspicion of criminal links. In April criminals 
who illegally sell land they do not own, often in nature reserves or 
indigenous areas, allegedly killed an indigenous environmental activist 
in Puerto Inca, Huanuco. In September an environmental activist was 
killed in the Madre de Dios region, where illegal mining is prevalent. 
Activists claimed the slow, ineffective process for punishing harassers 
effectively supported impunity.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Disappearance</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits such practices, but there were widespread 
reports the police employed them, particularly against protesters during
 then president Merinoâs November 10-15 presidency. National and 
international organizations, members of Congress, the press, and 
citizens alleged that these acts included: injury of more than 200 
persons, including three journalists; the mistreatment of detainees, 
including degrading and sexually abusive practices; and the deployment 
of covert police agents who used violence against peaceful 
demonstrators. In December an Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
(IACHR) mission to the country expressed concern regarding widespread 
reports of disproportionate violence and intimidating tactics by police 
against protesters, journalists, ombudsman staffers, and volunteer 
health workers.</p>
<p>Local and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the 
Office of the Ombudsman reported that police used cruel and degrading 
treatment and stated the government did not effectively prevent these 
abuses or punish those who committed them. According to NGO 
representatives, many victims did not file formal complaints about their
 alleged abusers, and those who did so purportedly had difficulty 
obtaining judicial redress and adequate compensation.</p>
<p>Impunity was a significant problem in the security forces. Following 
the November protests, the Sagasti government committed the government 
to launch internal investigations and to support the Public Ministry to 
investigate and sanction those responsible for police abuses during the 
protests. As of December the cases were under investigation. The Sagasti
 administrationâs first attempts at police reform shortly after the 
protests faced strong political resistance in Congress and within the 
police force itself.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h3>

					
					<p>Prison conditions were generally harsh due to overcrowding, 
improper sanitation, inadequate nutrition, poor health care, and 
corruption among guards, which included guards smuggling weapons and 
drugs into the prisons. Guards received little to no training or 
supervision.</p>
<p><u></u>Physical Conditions: As of August the National Penitentiary 
Institute (INPE) reported the prison system had 89,760 prisoners in 69 
facilities designed for a total of 40,137 prisoners. Of inmates, 37 
percent were in pretrial detention. The population at the Lurigancho 
penitentiary, the largest prison in the country, was 3.7 times its 
prescribed capacity.</p>
<p>Assaults on inmates by prison guards and fellow inmates occurred. An 
April riot at the Castro-Castro prison resulted in the deaths of 11 
inmates.</p>
<p>Inmates had only intermittent access to potable water. Bathing 
facilities were inadequate, kitchen facilities were unhygienic, and 
prisoners often slept in hallways and common areas due to the lack of 
cell space. INPE established medical isolation areas at each facility, 
but it was unclear if these spaces were sufficient to house affected 
inmates and reduce COVID-19 exposure for the rest of the general 
population in each facility. Prisoners with money or other resources had
 access to cell phones, illegal drugs, and better meals prepared outside
 the prison; prisoners who lacked funds experienced more difficult 
conditions.</p>
<p>Most prisons provided limited access to medical care, which resulted 
in delayed diagnoses of illnesses. The COVID-19 pandemic aggravated this
 situation. Inmates lacked access to required daily medications for 
chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, leading to 
subsequent complications such as blindness and limb amputation. 
Restrictions on visitations due to COVID-19 further limited inmate 
access to resources, since visits by relatives were a frequent source of
 food, medicine, and clothing for inmates.</p>
<p>Inmates complained of having to pay for medical attention. 
Tuberculosis, HIV, and AIDS reportedly remained at near-epidemic levels.
 The Ombudsmanâs Office reported insufficient accessibility and 
inadequate facilities for prisoners with disabilities. Prisoners with 
mental disabilities and mental health conditions usually lacked access 
to adequate psychological care.</p>
<p>Prisons became a critical COVID-19 hotspot during the pandemic, and 
the Ombudsmanâs Office urged the government in April to preserve life, 
health, and security inside prisons. As of July more than 2,600 inmates 
tested positive for COVID-19, and 249 died of the disease. The Ministry 
of Justice and Human Rights took urgent measures to reduce crowding and 
improve sanitary conditions in detention centers. As of July the 
government had pardoned or commuted the sentences of 1,929 inmates who 
met the eligibility conditions and released them. Eligibility conditions
 for pardons and commutations included a sentence for minor offenses 
only and having already served two-thirds of the jail sentence. Persons 
serving for crimes such as murder, rape, drug trafficking, and terrorism
 were not eligible for release. Additionally, 2,000 of 2,700 persons 
serving sentences for alimony debts were released upon debt payment.</p>
<p><u></u>Administration: Independent and government authorities investigated credible allegations of mistreatment.</p>
<p><u></u>Independent Monitoring: The government permitted monitoring 
visits by independent human rights and international humanitarian law 
observers. International Committee of the Red Cross officials and 
representatives of the Ombudsmanâs Office made unannounced visits to 
inmates in prisons and detention centers. The Ministry of Women and 
Vulnerable Populations and UNICEF monitored and advised on policies for 
juvenile detention centers.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention
 and provide for the right of any person to challenge in court the 
lawfulness of his or her arrest or detention. Following the November 9 
protests and change in government, citizens, domestic and international 
organizations, and members of Congress expressed concern that police did
 not follow lawful arrest and detention procedures during widespread 
political protests. The government constitutionally suspended the right 
to freedom from arrest without warrant in designated emergency zones and
 during the national state of emergency for COVID-19.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>The law requires a written judicial warrant based on sufficient 
evidence for an arrest unless authorities apprehended the alleged 
perpetrator of a crime in the act. Only judges may authorize detentions.
 The press, national and international organizations such as the IACHR, 
the Ombudsmanâs Office, members of Congress, and citizens alleged police
 did not respect these procedures during the November 10-15 protests.</p>
<p>The government constitutionally suspended the right to freedom from 
arrest without warrant during the national state of emergency declared 
on March 16 to fight the spread of COVID-19. In March and April, 55,000 
persons were arrested for not complying with curfews, social isolation, 
and other measures to fight the pandemic. The PNP detained offenders and
 charged significant fines.</p>
<p>Authorities are required to arraign arrested persons within 24 hours,
 except in cases of suspected terrorism, drug trafficking, or espionage,
 for which arraignment must take place within 15 days. In remote areas 
arraignment must take place as soon as practicable. Military authorities
 must turn over persons they detain to police within 24 hours. Police 
must file a report with the Public Ministry within 24 hours of an 
arrest. The Public Ministry in turn must issue its own assessment of the
 legality of the police action in the arrest; authorities respected this
 requirement.</p>
<p>The law permits detainees to have access to family members and a 
lawyer of their choice. Police may detain suspected terrorists 
incommunicado for 10 days.</p>
<p><u></u>Arbitrary Arrest: There were reports of unlawful detentions by
 police forces, including plainclothes officers, during November 10-15 
that allegedly led to the temporary disappearances of dozens of citizens
 who protested during this period. Some protesters alleged they were 
held for up to 72 hours. As of December the government was investigating
 these allegations.</p>
<p><u></u>Pretrial Detention: Lengthy pretrial detention remained a 
problem. According to an April report by INPE, 37 percent of prisoners 
were being held under pretrial detention. The length of pretrial 
detention occasionally equaled but did not exceed the maximum sentence 
of the alleged crime. Delays were due mainly to judicial inefficiency, 
corruption, and staff shortages. In accordance with the law, courts 
released prisoners held more than nine months (up to 36 months in 
complex cases) whom the justice system had not tried and sentenced. The 
courts factored pretrial detention into final sentences.</p>
<p>Official guidelines stipulate an accused individual must meet three 
conditions to receive pretrial detention: there should be reasonable 
evidence that the subject committed the crime; the penalty for the crime
 must be greater than a four-year prison sentence; and the subject is a 
flight risk or could obstruct the justice process through undue 
influence over key actors, including through coercion, corruption, or 
intimidation. The Constitutional Tribunal may consider the guidelines 
for current cases of pretrial detention as they deliberate habeas corpus
 requests. In March, Congress approved legislation that prevents the use
 of pretrial detention on police officers who kill or injure âwhile 
complying with their duties.â</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for an independent judiciary. Some NGO
 representatives and other advocates alleged the judiciary did not 
always operate independently, was not consistently impartial, and was 
sometimes subject to political influence and corruption. Authorities 
generally respected court orders from the judiciary.</p>
<p>Following a 2018 influence-peddling scandal involving judges and 
politicians, then president Vizcarra implemented measures to address 
judicial corruption, including replacing the National Council of 
Magistrates with a reformed version called the National Board of 
Justice. The National Council of Magistrates, the body in charge of 
selecting, evaluating, and punishing judges and prosecutors, was at the 
heart of the corruption scandal. The new National Board of Justice took 
office in January. It maintains the same responsibilities as the council
 but selects its members through a competitive public application 
process.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Trial Procedures</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the right to a fair and public trial, and 
the judiciary generally enforced this right, although reports of 
corruption in the judicial system were common. The government continued 
the implementation, begun in 2006, of the transition from an 
inquisitorial to an accusatory legal system and the application of a new
 criminal procedure code to streamline the penal process. As of 
September the government had introduced the code in 32 of the 34 
judicial districts. Implementation in the two largest judicial 
districts, Lima Center and Lima South, remained pending.</p>
<p>The law presumes all defendants are innocent. The government must 
promptly inform defendants in detail of the charges against them and 
provide defendants a trial without undue delay. Defendants have the 
right to be present at their trial and to communicate with an attorney 
of their choice or have one provided at public expense. State-provided 
attorneys, however, often had poor training and excessive caseloads. 
Although the law grants citizens the right to a trial in their own 
language, interpretation and translation services for non-Spanish 
speakers were not always available. This deficiency primarily affected 
speakers of indigenous Andean and Amazonian languages.</p>
<p>The law provides that all defendants have the right to adequate time 
and facilities to prepare their defense. Defendants have the right to 
confront adverse witnesses and present their own witnesses and evidence.
 The government cannot compel defendants to testify or confess to a 
crime. Defendants may appeal verdicts to a higher court and ultimately 
to the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Tribunal may rule on cases 
involving the constitutionality of laws and issues such as habeas 
corpus.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-9" class="report__section-subtitle">Political Prisoners and Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees during the year.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-10" class="report__section-subtitle">Civil Judicial Procedures and Remedies</h3>

					
					<p>Citizens may seek civil remedies for human rights violations, 
but court cases often take years to resolve. Press reports, NGOs, and 
other sources alleged that persons outside the judiciary frequently 
corrupted or influenced judges.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-11" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Arbitrary or Unlawful Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits such actions, and there were no reports that 
the government failed to respect these prohibitions. The national state 
of emergency declared on March 16 for COVID-19 allowed authorities to 
inspect places suspected of violating public health regulations such as 
curfew times and prohibition of large gatherings. The governmentâs 
continued declaration of an emergency zone in the VRAEM due to drug 
trafficking and terrorist activity suspended the right to home 
inviolability in that region.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for freedom of expression, including 
for the press, and the government generally respected this right. An 
independent press and a functioning democratic political system 
generally promoted freedom of expression, including for the press.</p>
<p>The March-June COVID-19 quarantine regulations included journalists 
and reporters as one of the essential services allowed to transit for 
work. The National Association of Reporters (ANP) expressed concern for 
the precarious work conditions for reporters, which included reporting 
without adequate protective equipment from areas with a high prevalence 
of COVID-19. The ANP reported 82 reporters died due to COVID-19 between 
March and August, 35 of whom contracted the disease while reporting from
 the field.</p>
<p><u></u>Violence and Harassment: The Institute of Press and Society 
(IPYS) and the ANP issued 21 alerts for violence against and harassment 
of reporters, including threats from local government representatives 
and a leader of illegal coca growers. IPYS and the ANP reported 
journalist Daysi Lizeth Mina Huaman went missing on January 26, the day 
of congressional elections. Mina Huaman was last seen in Santa Rosa, 
Ayacucho, in the VRAEM region, which had a strong drug-trafficking 
presence, where she went to vote and conduct interviews about the 
elections. It was unclear whether her disappearance was related to her 
work as a journalist.</p>
<p>IPYS denounced PNP aggression towards journalists who covered local 
protests in July, as well as injuries suffered by three journalists 
beaten by police during the November protests. It also denounced 
recurring death threats and online harassment of journalists by 
anonymous assailants and alleged business and political representatives.</p>
<p><u></u>Censorship or Content Restrictions: There were no reports of 
official censorship. NGOs reported that some media, most notably in 
locations with a strong presence of illicit activities, practiced 
self-censorship due to fear of reprisal by local authorities with links 
to those activities. During the November protests, police detained a man
 and a woman working at a Lima print shop for producing protest 
materials. The woman alleged she was sexually assaulted during 
detention.</p>
<p><u></u>Nongovernmental Impact: NGO representatives reported that 
local figures linked to a wide array of political and economic interests
 threatened press freedom by intimidating local journalists who reported
 on those activities. This was particularly acute in areas with a strong
 presence of illegal activities.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Internet Freedom</h3>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">Academic Freedom and Cultural Events</h3>

assembly and association, and the government generally respected these 
rights. Under the COVID-19 national state of emergency that began on 
March 16, the government imposed exceptional restrictions on movement 
and assembly, including curfews, mandatory quarantines, and bans on 
travel and assembly. Citizens, domestic and international organizations,
 and members of Congress claimed the rights of peaceful assembly and 
demonstration were not respected in the context of November political 
protests.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Freedom of Peaceful Assembly</h3>

					
					<p>The law does not require a permit for public demonstrations, but
 organizers must report the type of demonstration planned and coordinate
 its intended location with authorities. The constitution specifies the 
rights of freedom of unarmed assembly and association. Under the 
COVID-19 national state of emergency, the government suspended the right
 of assembly between March 16 and June 30. As of September large-scale 
gatherings remained suspended. Freedom of assembly remained suspended in
 the VRAEM and La Pampa emergency zones, where armed elements of the 
Shining Path terrorist group and drug traffickers operated.</p>
<p>The government may restrict or prohibit demonstrations at specific 
times and places to ensure public safety and health. Police used tear 
gas and force occasionally to disperse protesters in various 
demonstrations. Although most demonstrations were peaceful, protests in 
some areas turned violent, resulting in 10 deaths as of November. 
Allegations of abuses against the right of freedom of peaceful assembly 
were widespread during the November protests.</p>

respected these rights.</p>
<p><u></u>In-country Movement: The government maintained an emergency 
zone including restrictions on movement in the VRAEM due to the presence
 of the Shining Path, drug trafficking, and transnational organized 
crime.</p>
<p>Drug traffickers and Shining Path members at times interrupted the 
free movement of persons by establishing roadblocks in sections of the 
VRAEM emergency zone. Individuals protesting extractive industry 
projects also occasionally established roadblocks throughout the

					<p>The Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populationsâ National 
Registry for Displaced Persons recognized 59,846 displaced persons in 
the country, most of whom were victims of the 1980-2000 internal 
conflict. The registration and accreditation of displaced persons 
provided for their protection, care, and humanitarian assistance during 
displacement, return, or resettlement. According to the governmentâs 
Reparations Council, some internally displaced persons who were victims 
of the 1980-2000 internal conflict experienced difficulties registering 
for reparations due to a lack of proper identity documents.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-9" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Protection of Refugees</h3>

					
					<p>The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations 
in providing protection and assistance to refugees, returning refugees, 
asylum seekers, stateless persons, and other persons of concern.</p>
<p>More than one million foreign-born persons, including immigrants, 
refugees, and asylum seekers, lived in the country as of August. 
Venezuelans were the largest nationality, numbering more than one 
million. Of the Venezuelans, 58 percent were women. The government 
granted 486,000 temporary residence permits (PTPs) in 2017 and 2018 to 
Venezuelans, after which it discontinued the program. PTP holders may 
legally reside and work in the country before their PTP expires while 
they transition to another, regular migratory status. These other 
statuses include a âspecial migratory resident statusâ designed for PTP 
holders who can certify economic activity and no criminal record. This 
status adjustment results in a foreign resident status and an 
identification equivalent in most ways to a Peruvian citizenâs national 
identification. As of September an estimated 200,000 Venezuelans held 
regular foreign resident identification. Although the last valid PTPs 
were set to expire during the year, the government extended the validity
 of all identification documents to December 31, 2020, due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><u></u>Access to Asylum: The law provides for the granting of asylum 
or refugee status, and the government has established a system for 
protecting refugees. The government cooperated with UNHCR and recognized
 the Peruvian Catholic Migration Commission as the official provider of 
technical assistance to refugees. The commission also advised persons 
who sought asylum based on a fear of persecution. The government 
protected refugees on a renewable, year-to-year basis in accordance with
 commission recommendations.</p>
<p><u></u>Durable Solutions: The government does not have a formalized 
integration program for refugees, but it received persons recognized as 
refugees by other nations, granted refugee status to persons who applied
 from within Peru, and provided some administrative support toward their
 integration. UNHCR provided these refugees with humanitarian and 
emergency aid, legal assistance, documentation, and, in exceptional 
cases, voluntary return, and family reunification.</p>
<p><u></u>Temporary Protection: As of September the government provided 
temporary protection to more than 500,000 individuals since 2017 while 
they awaited a decision on their refugee status. Nearly all of them were
 Venezuelan. The government provided these individuals with temporary 
residence permits and authorization to work while they waited for a more
 permanent legal status, such as approval of their asylum application or
 change to foreign resident migratory status. Following the COVID-19 
national state of emergency, the government extended until December 31 
the validity of asylum-seeker identification documents set to expire 
during the year.</p>

					<p>The law provides citizens the ability to choose their national 
and local government in free and fair periodic elections held by secret 
ballot and based on universal, compulsory, and equal suffrage.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-3__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Elections and Political Participation</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Recent Elections: Elections were held in April 2016 for 
Congress and president. Domestic and international observers declared 
the elections to be fair and transparent, despite controversy over the 
exclusion of two presidential candidates for administrative violations 
of election-related laws. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski won and assumed the 
presidency in July 2016, with Martin Vizcarra as first vice president. 
President Kuczynski resigned in March 2018, a few days before his 
impeachment hearing on corruption allegations. Pursuant to the 
constitution, in March 2018 First Vice President Vizcarra assumed the 
presidency following Kuczynskiâs resignation. Congress voted to remove 
Vizcarra under the âpermanent moral incapacityâ clause of the 
constitution, and President of Congress Manuel Merino assumed the 
interim presidency on November 10. Merino resigned on November 15 
following widespread protests and the deaths of two protesters. Congress
 appointed Francisco Sagasti as its president on November 16, and per 
the constitutionâs order of succession, Sagasti then assumed the 
presidency of the country.</p>
<p>The country held free and fair legislative elections on January 26, 
following President Vizcarraâs constitutional dissolution of Congress in
 September 2019. Political opponents of Vizcarra presented a challenge 
in the Constitutional Tribunal to the dissolution. In January the 
Constitutional Tribunal ruled the presidentâs dissolution of Congress 
was constitutional, but it recommended amendment of the relevant 
articles of the constitution for clarity.</p>
<p><u></u>Political Parties and Political Participation: By law groups 
that advocate the violent overthrow of the government and adhere to 
ideologies intrinsically incompatible with democracy cannot register as 
political parties. In September the government enacted a constitutional 
amendment that prohibits individuals with a criminal record from running
 for public office.</p>
<p><u></u>Participation of Women and <u></u>Members of <u></u>Minorit<u></u>y
 Groups: No laws limit participation of women or members of minority 
groups in the political process, and they did participate. In June 
Congress approved a law requiring gender parity in political partiesâ 
lists of congressional candidates, in party lists to elect regional 
assemblies, in party tickets to elect regional governors and vice 
governors, and in party tickets to elect the president and vice 
presidents. This law raises a previous quota of 30 percent for each 
gender in congressional lists to 50 percent. Of the 130 members of 
Congress, 33 were women in the 2020-21 term, compared with 36 during the
 dissolved 2016-19 term, and 28 in the 2011-16 term. The advent of 
Sagastiâs government brought more women leaders to the fore. As of 
December the judiciary and the Ministry of Defense were led by women for
 the first time. Women also served as prime minister, attorney general, 
head of the Constitutional Court, and interim president of Congress.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for corruption by officials;
 however, the government did not implement the law effectively, and 
officials often engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. There were 
numerous reports of corruption by government officials during the year. 
Citizens continued to view corruption as a pervasive problem in all 
branches of national, regional, and local governments.</p>
<p><u></u>Corruption: Several high-profile political figures remained 
under investigation for corruption, particularly in relation to the well
 publicized Odebrecht corruption scandal.</p>
<p>Authorities transferred two-time presidential runner-up Keiko 
Fujimori from preventive detention to house arrest in May during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, while they continued investigating her for 
obstruction of justice and money laundering of campaign donations.</p>
<p>There were widespread allegations of corruption in public procurement
 and in public-private partnerships. Large transportation and energy 
infrastructure contracts frequently generated high-ranking political 
interference and corruption, including by former presidents and regional
 governors. Companies also reported midlevel government officials skewed
 tender specifications to favor bidders that paid bribes.</p>
<p>There was evidence of widespread corruption in the judicial system. 
Prosecutors continued an investigation launched following 2018 media 
reports on a judicial scandal involving allegations of influence 
peddling and graft by judges at all levels. Corruption was frequent at 
all levels of the PNP.</p>
<p><u></u>Financial Disclosure: Elected public officials and high-level 
appointed officials must submit personal financial information to the 
Office of the Comptroller General prior to taking office and 
periodically thereafter. The comptroller monitors and verifies 
disclosures, but the law was not strongly enforced. Administrative 
punishments for noncompliance may include suspension between 30 days and
 one year, a ban on signing government contracts, and a ban on holding 
government office. The comptroller makes disclosures available to the 
public.</p>

					<p>A variety of domestic and international human rights groups 
generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
were somewhat cooperative and responsive to their views.</p>
<p><u></u>Government Human Rights Bodies: The Ministry of Justice and 
Human Rights, and in particular the Vice-Ministry of Human Rights and

The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable 
Populations also had significant human rights roles. These government

<p>The independent Office of the Ombudsman operated without government 
or party interference. NGOs, civil society organizations, and the public

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">Women</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Rape and Domestic Violence: The law criminalizes rape of 
men and women, including spousal rape. Penalties are a minimum of 14 
years and a maximum of life in prison. Enforcement was inadequate.</p>
<p>The law defines femicide as the crime of killing of a woman or girl 
based on expectations, assumptions, or factors distinctive to her 
gender. The minimum sentence for femicide is 20 years, and 30 years when
 the crime includes aggravating circumstances (e.g., crimes against 
minor, elderly, or pregnant victims). Enforcement of the law was slow, 
and prosecution of cases was often ineffective.</p>
<p>The law prohibits domestic violence; penalties range from one month 
to six years in prison. The law authorizes judges and prosecutors to 
prevent a convicted spouse or parent from returning to the family home. 
The law also authorizes the victimâs relatives and unrelated persons 
living in the home to file complaints of domestic violence. The law 
requires a police investigation of domestic violence to take place 
within five days of a complaint and obliges authorities to extend 
protection to female victims of domestic violence. Enforcement of the 
law was lax.</p>
<p>Violence against women and girls, and sexual, physical, and 
psychological abuse were serious, underreported national problems. A 
government health survey from 2019 released in June stated 57 percent of
 women ages 15 to 49 had suffered physical, psychological, or sexual 
violence in the previous 12 months. COVID-19 quarantine laws posed 
increased challenges, since a substantial proportion of violence against
 women took place in the home. Between March and July, the Ministry of 
Women and Vulnerable Populations reported more than 36,000 cases of 
violence against women, including 36 femicides, 32 attempted femicides, 
and 800 cases of sexual abuse. As of August more than 1,200 women and 
girls were reported as âmissingâ during the COVID-19 quarantine, placing
 them at high risk of human trafficking or other forms of violence and 
exploitation.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Women operated service centers for victims of 
domestic violence and sexual abuse and their accompanying children. 
These centers provided short-term shelter as well as legal, 
psychological, and social services. NGO representatives expressed 
concerns about the quality and quantity of the programâs services, 
particularly in rural areas. The ministry operated a toll-free hotline 
and implemented projects to sensitize government employees and the 
citizenry to domestic violence. The Public Ministry operated emergency 
spaces that women and children could use for short-term accommodation, 
and the government made efforts to expand temporary shelters, but NGO 
representatives and members of Congress stated there were not enough.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Womenâs mobile emergency teams, composed of social 
workers and mental health professionals, aided women in highly 
vulnerable situations during the strict quarantine period from March 16 
to May 31. The ministry reported attending to victims of rape (more than
 half of whom were minors) in that period, while acknowledging a 
shortage of rape kits. During the first week of quarantine in March 
alone, the ministry received 2,436 complaints through its hotline, 
responded to one femicide, and coordinated with police to intervene in 
207 conflicts.</p>
<p><u></u>Sexual Harassment: Sexual harassment was a serious problem. 
The law defines sexual harassment as comments, touching, or actions of a
 sexual nature that are unsolicited and unwanted by victim. Sexual 
harassment is a crime with a penalty of up to eight years in prison. 
Sexual harassment in the workplace is also a labor rights violation 
subject to administrative penalties. Government enforcement of the law 
was minimal.</p>
<p>In February courts confirmed the 2019 sentence of a man for sexual 
harassment and imposed a sentence of four years and eight months in 
prison. This was the first ever conviction for sexual harassment of an 
adult victim.</p>
<p><u></u>Coercion in Population Control: There were no reports of 
coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization on the part of government 
authorities.</p>
<p><u></u>Discrimination: The law provides for equality between men and 
women. It prohibits gender-based discrimination between partners 
regarding marriage, divorce, pregnancy, pay, and property rights. The 
government did not enforce the law effectively.</p>
<p>Arbitrary dismissal of pregnant women and workplace discrimination 
against women were common. The law stipulates that women should receive 
equal pay for equal work, but women often were paid less than men.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Children</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Birth Registration: Citizenship is derived either by 
birth within the countryâs territory or from either of the parents. The 
state grants a national identification card and number upon birth, which
 are essential to access most public and many private services. Rural 
Amazonian areas had the lowest coverage of national identification 
cards. Government and NGO representatives assessed that undocumented 
individuals were particularly vulnerable to labor exploitation, human 
trafficking, and other crimes.</p>
<p><u></u>Child Abuse: The law requires all government authorities, 
courts, and social service institutions to use the âbest interests of 
the childâ standard in decisions affecting abused children. The law 
imposes between six years and lifetime prison sentences for crimes 
listed as âchild abuse,â including sexual exploitation of children, 
abusing minors, and child trafficking, but these crimes were sometimes 
confused with each other. Police did not always collect the evidence to 
meet the prosecutorâs evidentiary burden, and judges regularly applied a
 higher evidentiary threshold than required, resulting in courts 
applying lesser, easier-to-prove charges, particularly in trafficking 
cases.</p>
<p>Violence against children, including sexual abuse, was a serious 
nationwide problem. At-risk children may be placed with guardians or in 
specialized residential facilities for different kinds of victims. Not 
all shelters provided psychological care, although the law requires it. 
In most regions residential shelters operated by provincial or district 
authorities were supplemented by shelters operated by schools, churches,
 and NGOs. The Ministry of Women opened four specialized shelters 
between January and February for female child trafficking victims that 
provided psychosocial, medical, and legal support.</p>
<p><u></u>Child, <u></u>Early<u></u>,<u></u> and Forced Marriage: The 
legal minimum age of marriage is 18. The law allows a civil judge to 
authorize minors older than 16 to marry. According to the 2017 census, 
there were 55,000 married teenagers, 80 percent of them girls.</p>
<p><u></u>Sexual Exploitation of Children: The law prohibits child 
pornography and stipulates a penalty of six to 12 yearsâ imprisonment 
and a fine. The law prohibits child sex trafficking, with a minimum 
penalty of eight to 15 years in prison if the victim is age 18 or older,
 12 to 20 years in prison if the victim is 14 to 17, and 25 to 35 years 
if the victim is 13 or younger. Government officials and NGOs identified
 numerous cases of child sex-trafficking during the year, although 
officials continued to classify many child sex-trafficking crimes as 
sexual exploitation, which provides fewer protections to victims. While 
the COVID-19 pandemic brought tourism in general to a halt, the country 
remained a destination for child sex tourism, and NGO representatives 
reported an increase in online sexual exploitation during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Although the country has strong laws to protect children, it 
frequently had serious problems with enforcement. Media reported on the 
sex and labor trafficking of minor girls and women in the illicit 
gold-mining sites of the remote Amazonian Madre de Dios region. Law 
enforcement operations against illegal mining sites were not effective 
in identifying victims and removing them from exploitation.</p>
<p>The minimum age for consensual sex is 14. A conviction for rape of a 
child younger than 14 by an adult carries life imprisonment. The law 
also prohibits adults from using deceit, abuse of power, or taking 
advantage of a child in a vulnerable situation to have sex with a person
 younger than 18.</p>

<p><u></u>International Child Abductions: The country is a party to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction.

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Persons with Disabilities</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination against persons with 
disabilities, defined as individuals with a physical, sensory, or mental
 impairment that limits one or more major life activities. The law 
establishes infractions and punishments for noncompliance. It provides 
for the protection, care, rehabilitation, security, and social inclusion
 of persons with disabilities, and mandates that public spaces and 
government internet sites to be accessible to them. It requires the 
inclusion of sign language or subtitles in all educational and cultural 
programs on public television and in media available in public 
libraries. The government generally did not effectively enforce the law.</p>
<p>The law requires companies to have job selection processes that give 
persons with disabilities the opportunity to apply for jobs on equal 
terms with persons without disabilities. The law also requires employers
 to provide employees up to 56 hours of leave per year to accompany 
their relatives with disabilities to medical appointments.</p>
<p>The government failed to enforce laws protecting the rights of 
persons with mental disabilities. NGO representatives and government 
officials reported an insufficient number of medical personnel providing
 services in psychiatric institutions.</p>
<p>Persons with disabilities faced immense challenges due to 
inaccessible infrastructure, minimal access to education, insufficient 
employment opportunities, and discrimination, according to government 
and civil society leaders. The Ombudsmanâs Office reported approximately
 87 percent of children with disabilities did not attend school and 76 
percent of persons with disabilities did not work. One government survey
 reported that 70 percent of employers stated they would not hire a 
person with a disability.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Indigenous People</h3>

					
					<p>Indigenous persons remained politically, economically, and 
socially disadvantaged. They faced threats from land grabbers, narcotics
 traffickers, illegal miners, illegal loggers, and extractive industries
 that operated near or within indigenous land holdings, often in the 
Amazon. Indigenous persons were particularly at risk for both sex and 
labor trafficking. Many indigenous persons who lived in rural 
communities had limited access to justice, protection, or abuse 
prevention activities. Indigenous leaders expressed concerns that the 
national and regional governments did not adequately protect indigenous 
peoples and their property interests. In April an indigenous Kakataibo 
leader was killed in Puerto Inca, Huanuco, allegedly by criminals 
illegally selling land. In August, three indigenous Kukama citizens died
 after a clash with police while protesting oil extraction operations in
 Bretana, Loreto.</p>
<p>While the constitution recognizes that indigenous peoples have the 
right to own land communally, indigenous groups often lacked legal title
 to demarcate the boundaries of their land. Amazonian indigenous peoples
 continued to accuse the national government of delaying the issuance of
 land titles. By law indigenous communities retain the right of 
unassignability, which should prevent the title to indigenous lands from
 being reassigned to a nonindigenous person. Some indigenous community 
members, however, sold land to outsiders without the majority consent of
 their community.</p>
<p>The national government retains subsurface mineral rights for land 
nationwide. This led to disputes between local indigenous communities, 
the national government, regional governments, and various extractive 
industry interests. The law requires the government to consult with 
indigenous communities on proposed extractive projects or on changes to 
current extractive projects. The law also requires the government to 
produce a detailed implementation plan to facilitate government and 
private-sector compliance; implementation of this law was somewhat 
effective.</p>
<p>The law requires the Ministry of Culture to establish a database of 
indigenous communities entitled to consultation. As of August the 
ministry recognized 55 indigenous peoples as entitled to âprior 
consultationâ and confirmed the existence of another 14 indigenous 
peoples in voluntary isolation, with very limited or no contact with the
 rest of the country. From 2014 to 2019, the government initiated 24 
prior consultations with various indigenous communities, which generated
 487 agreements. Of those 24 prior consultations, 10 had concluded and 
14 continued.</p>
<p>NGOs, legal experts, and the Ombudsmanâs Office expressed concern 
that indigenous communities did not have sufficient training to engage 
fairly in consultations with the government and extractive industries.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">Acts of Violence, Criminalization, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h3>

					
					<p>Discrimination, harassment, and abuse of transgender women and 
girls, including by police and other authorities, was a problem. During 
the COVID-19 national state of emergency, there was evidence of 
mistreatment of transgender citizens by police, particularly during a 
two-week period in which an emergency decree mandated that men and women
 were only allowed on the streets on alternate days. Lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons were particularly 
vulnerable to human trafficking and largely lacked access to 
comprehensive protective services.</p>
<p>The constitution prohibits discrimination, and individuals can file 
legal claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender 
identity. Few national laws mention sexual orientation and gender 
identity as explicit categories for protection from discrimination, 
which left room for interpretations that overlook rights for LGBTI 
persons. Some regions and municipalities, including Piura, La Libertad, 
Loreto, and San Martin, have regulations that explicitly prohibit 
discrimination against LGBTI persons and provide administrative relief 
but not criminal sanctions.</p>
<p>The law does not provide transgender persons the right to update 
their national identity documents to reflect their gender identity. 
Transgender persons, therefore, often did not have valid national 
identification cards. This limited their access to government services. 
In August courts ordered the National Identity and Civil Status Registry
 to allow citizens to change their gender, name, and picture to reflect 
their current identity. As of November the case was under appeal by the 
government.</p>
<p>Government officials, NGO representatives, journalists, and 
civil-society leaders reported official and societal discrimination 
against LGBTI persons in employment, housing, education, law 
enforcement, and health care based on sexual orientation and gender 
identity. NGO representatives reported that law enforcement authorities 
repeatedly failed to protect, and on occasion violated, the rights of

					<p>Persons with HIV and AIDS faced discrimination and harassment, 
including societal discrimination, with respect to employment, housing, 
and social inclusion. The Ministry of Health implemented policies to 
combat discrimination based on HIV and AIDS status. HIV and AIDS 
affected transgender women and girls disproportionately, and many 
transgender women could not obtain health care because they lacked 
national identification cards reflecting their gender and appearance.</p>

					<p>In June the Ombudsmanâs Office reported 140 active social 
conflicts and 50 latent ones. Social conflicts around extractive 
industries and socioenvironmental issues were 67 percent of the total 
number of social conflicts. Half of all social conflicts related to 
mining. As of August, 119 conflicts escalated to violence, resulting in a
 total of six deaths. In August media denounced physical abuses by 
police against citizens protesting mining operations in Espinar, Cusco. 
As of August the case remained under investigation.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>With certain limitations, labor laws and regulations provide for
 freedom of association, the right to strike, and collective bargaining.
 The law prohibits intimidation by employers and other forms of 
antiunion discrimination. It requires reinstatement or compensation of 
workers fired for union activity. The law allows workers to form unions 
without seeking prior authorization. By law at least 20 workers must be 
affiliated to form an enterprise-level union and 50 workers must be 
affiliated to form a sector-wide union or federation. Some labor 
activists viewed this requirement as prohibitively high, particularly 
for small and medium-sized businesses, which represented 96.5 percent of
 all businesses.</p>
<p>Long-term employment under short-term contract schemes was 
widespread, including in the public sector. The use of unlimited 
consecutive short-term contracts made the exercise of freedom of 
association and collective bargaining difficult.</p>
<p>Private-sector labor law sets out nine categories of short-term 
employment contracts that companies may use. The law sets time limits on
 contracts in each category and has a five-year overall limit on the 
consecutive use of short-term contracts. A sector-specific law covering 
parts of the textile and apparel sectors exempts employers from this 
five-year limit and allows employers to hire workers indefinitely on 
short-term contracts. The law provides for hiring, compensation, and 
paid-leave benefits for agricultural workers until 2031, including 
consecutive short-term contracts.</p>
<p>In August a leader of a street-cleaning union denounced physical 
aggression by unidentified persons who threatened her, allegedly due to 
her public demands for better labor conditions. As of August the case 
remained under investigation.</p>
<p>The law allows unions to declare a strike in accordance with their 
governing documents, with prior notice of five days for the private 
sector, 10 days for the public sector, and 15 days for emergency 
services. Essential services must also receive the approval of the 
Ministry of Labor to strike and provide a sufficient number of workers 
during a strike to maintain operations. Neither private-sector nor 
public-sector institutions may legally dismiss workers who strike.</p>
<p>The government did not effectively enforce the law on freedom of 
association, collective bargaining, or other labor laws. Penalties were 
not commensurate with penalties for other laws involving denials of 
civil rights, such as discrimination.</p>
<p>Penalties for violations of freedom of association and collective 
bargaining were insufficient to deter violations and, according to labor
 experts and union representatives, were rarely enforced. Workers faced 
prolonged judicial processes and lack of enforcement following 
dismissals for trade union activity.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor, but 
the government did not always enforce it effectively. The law prescribes
 penalties of eight to 15 yearsâ imprisonment for labor trafficking and 
six to 12 yearsâ imprisonment for a separate crime of forced labor. 
Penalties were not commensurate with penalties for analogous crimes, 
such as kidnapping. Forced labor crimes continued to occur in domestic 
service, agriculture, forestry, mining and related services, factories, 
counterfeit operations, brick making, and organized street begging. 
Illegal logging, which had a devastating impact on the landscape and the
 environment, affected many indigenous communities who found themselves 
trapped in forced labor. The narcoterrorist organization Shining Path 
used force and coercion to recruit children to serve as combatants or 
guards. Shining Path also used force and coercion to subject children 
and adults to forced labor in agriculture, cultivating or transporting 
illicit narcotics, and domestic servitude, as well as to carry out 
terrorist activities.</p>
<p>Officials from the National Labor Inspectorate participated in joint 
operations with police that led to the identification of victims of 
forced labor. The government also continued to implement the <i>National Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons 2017-21</i>.</p>
<p>Also see the Department of Stateâs <i>Trafficking in Persons Report</i> at <a class="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210330232452/https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/" target="_self"> <span class="external-link-title">https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/</span></a>.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all the worst forms of child labor. The legal 
minimum age for employment varies from 12 to 18 depending on the type of
 job, the job conditions, and the hours per day. Employment must not 
affect school attendance. A permit from the Labor Ministry is required 
for persons younger than 18 to work legally. Parents must apply for the 
permit, and employers must have a permit on file to hire a minor. In 
September Congress approved legislation that forbids children younger 
than 18 to be domestic workers.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor and the National Labor Inspectorate are 
responsible for enforcing child labor laws, but enforcement was not 
effective, especially in the informal sector where most child labor 
occurred. Penalties were not commensurate with penalties for analogous 
crimes.</p>
<p>A government report found the prevalence of child labor was 22 
percent in 2018; however, 59 percent of households in extreme poverty 
had a child laborer. In addition there were four times more child 
laborers in rural areas than in urban areas. Among the population of 
working children, 57 percent worked in agriculture and 21 percent worked
 in small-scale or street retail.</p>
<p>Also see the Department of Laborâs <i>Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor</i> at <a class="external-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210330232452/https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/findings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span class="external-link-title">https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/findings</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, skin 
color, sex, religion, political opinion, national origin, citizenship, 
social origin, disability, age, language, or social status. The law does
 not specifically identify discrimination based on sexual orientation, 
gender identity, HIV-positive status, or other communicable diseases. 
The law establishes the following employment quotas for persons with 
disabilities: 3 percent for private businesses with more than 50 
employees and 5 percent for public-sector organizations. The law 
prohibits discrimination against domestic workers and prohibits any 
requirement by employers for their domestic workers to wear uniforms in 
public places. The National Council for the Integration of Persons with 
Disabilities oversees compliance with employment quotas for persons with
 disabilities. Compliance with quotas varied and enforcement was not 
always effective.</p>
<p>The government did not effectively enforce the law on discrimination.
 Penalties were not commensurate to laws related to civil rights, such 
as election interference. NGO representatives and labor rights advocates
 noted that discrimination cases often went unreported.</p>
<p>A report by the Ombudsmanâs Office found that in 2017, 28 percent of 
working-age women were not performing paid labor, compared with 10 
percent of working-age men.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for a national minimum wage, which was above 
the official estimate for the poverty income level. The government did 
not effectively enforce wage laws, and penalties were not commensurate 
with those for similar crimes, such as fraud.</p>
<p>The law provides for a 48-hour workweek and one day of rest for 
workers in the formal sector. There is no prohibition on excessive 
compulsory overtime, nor does the law limit the amount of overtime that a
 worker may work. The law stipulates 30 calendar days of paid annual 
vacation. In September, Congress approved legislation that aligns the 
labor rights of domestic workers with the rights of regular, 
formal-sector workers. The new law replaces previous laws that granted 
diminished rights to domestic workers, such as less vacation time and 
smaller yearly bonuses. The new law elevates the minimum age to perform 
domestic service jobs to 18.</p>
<p>Noncompliance with labor law is punishable by fines. Penalties were 
not commensurate with those for similar crimes, such as fraud. According
 to a labor NGO and labor experts, many fines went uncollected, in part 
because the government lacked an efficient tracking system and at times 
lacked political will. Labor inspectors have the authority to make 
unannounced inspections and initiate sanctions.</p>
<p>The law has fines and criminal sanctions for occupational safety and 
health (OSH) violations. The government did not effectively enforce OSH 
laws, and penalties for these violations were not commensurate with 
penalties for analogous crimes such as negligence. The number of labor 
inspectors was not sufficient to enforce compliance. Criminal penalties 
are limited to cases where employers deliberately violated OSH laws, and
 where labor authorities had previously and repeatedly notified 
employers who subsequently did not adopt corrective measures. The law 
requires workers to prove an employerâs culpability before they can 
obtain compensation for work-related injuries.</p>
<p>In January a tanker truck transporting liquefied petroleum gas 
exploded in Lima, killing two and injuring dozens. Observers said the 
event was caused by a lack of enforcement of security and safety 
standards. In late June another explosion took place in an industrial 
complex in Arequipa where inspectors were testing a boiler, resulting in
 three dead workers and two injured.</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, many retail workers expressed concerns 
regarding inadequate health and safety protections, saying employers 
gave them only one mask per week. More than 20 workers alleged they were
 unjustly dismissed after asking for better protection against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Representatives of labor, business, and the government reported that 
the majority of companies in the formal sector generally complied with 
the law. Many workers in the informal economy, approximately 70 percent 
of the total labor force, received less than the minimum wage. Most 
informal workers were self-employed. Nearly 90 percent of Venezuelan 
migrant workers were in the informal sector, most of them in suboptimal 
conditions and earning less than the minimum wage due to their lack of 
proper documentation and inability to validate their academic 
credentials.</p>
