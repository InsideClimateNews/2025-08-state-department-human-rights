				<h2 id="report-toc__exec-summary" class="report__section-title">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>

				<hr>
<p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong> The Department of State will release 
an addendum to this report in mid 2021 that expands the subsection on 
Women in Section 6 to include a broader range of issues related to 
reproductive rights.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Philippines is a multiparty, constitutional republic with a 
bicameral legislature. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, elected in May 
2016, began his constitutionally limited six-year term in June 2016. 
Midterm elections in May 2019 for 12 (of 24 total) senators, all 
congressional representatives, and local government leaders were seen as
 generally free and fair, despite reports of violence and vote buying. 
The ruling party and allies won all 12 Senate seats and maintained an 
approximately two-thirds majority in the 306-seat House of 
Representatives. Barangay (village) and youth council elections 
originally scheduled for 2021 were rescheduled for December 5, 2022, so 
that local and national elections would occur in the same year.</p>
<p>The Philippine National Police is charged with maintaining internal 
security in most of the country and reports to the Department of the 
Interior. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (armed forces), which 
reports to the Department of National Defense, is responsible for 
external security but also carries out domestic security functions in 
regions with a high incidence of conflict, particularly the Mindanao 
region. The two agencies share responsibility for counterterrorism and 
counterinsurgency operations. The national police Special Action Force 
is responsible for urban counterterrorism operations. Governors, mayors,
 and other local officials have considerable influence over local police
 units, including appointment of top departmental and municipal police 
officers and the provision of resources. The government continued to 
support and arm civilian militias. The armed forces controlled Civilian 
Armed Force Geographical Units, while Civilian Volunteer Organizations 
fell under national police command. These paramilitary units often 
received minimal training and were poorly monitored and regulated. Some 
political families and clan leaders, particularly in Mindanao, 
maintained private armies and, at times, recruited Civilian Volunteer 
Organization and Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit members into 
those armies. Civilian control over security forces was not fully 
effective. Members of the security forces committed numerous abuses.</p>
<p>Significant human rights issues included: unlawful or arbitrary 
killings, including extrajudicial killings, by and on behalf of the 
government and nonstate actors; reports of forced disappearance by and 
on behalf of the government and nonstate actors; torture by and on 
behalf of the government and nonstate actors; harsh and life-threatening
 prison conditions; arbitrary detention by and on behalf of the 
government and nonstate actors; significant problems with the 
independence of the judiciary; arbitrary and unlawful interference with 
privacy; unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers by terrorists and
 groups in rebellion against the government; serious restrictions on 
free expression and the press, including violence, threats of violence, 
and unjustified arrests or prosecutions of journalists, censorship, and 
the use of criminal libel laws to punish journalists; and corruption.</p>
<p>The government investigated a limited number of reported human rights
 abuses, including abuses by its own forces, paramilitaries, and 
insurgent and terrorist groups. Concerns about police impunity continued
 following the increase in killings by police in 2016. Significant 
concerns also persisted about impunity for other security forces, 
civilian national and local government officials, and powerful business 
and commercial figures. Slow judicial processes remained an obstacle to 
bringing government officials allegedly involved in human rights abuses 
to justice.</p>
<p>Muslim separatists, communist insurgents, and terrorist groups 
continued to attack government security forces and civilians, causing 
displacement of civilians and resulting in the deaths of security force 
members and civilians. Terrorist organizations engaged in kidnappings 
for ransom, bombings of civilian targets, beheadings, and the use of 
child soldiers in combat or auxiliary roles.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were numerous reports that government security agencies 
and their informal allies committed arbitrary or unlawful killings in 
connection with the government-directed campaign against illegal drugs. 
Various government bodies conducted investigations into whether security
 force killings were justifiable, such as the national police Internal 
Affairs Service, the armed forces Human Rights Office, and the National 
Bureau of Investigation. Impunity remained a problem, however. Killings 
of activists, judicial officials, local government leaders, and 
journalists by government allies, antigovernment insurgents, and unknown
 assailants also continued. In August peace activist Randall âRandyâ 
Echanis was tortured and killed by unknown individuals who broke into 
his Quezon City residence. Tensions later escalated when police seized 
Echanisâ remains from a funeral home.</p>
<p>Approximately 20,000 antidrug operations were conducted from January 
to August 2020, according to government data. In a House committee 
hearing in September, the new Philippine National Police (PNP) chief 
General Camilo Cascolan reported 623 suspects killed and 50,429 arrested
 during drug operations conducted from January to August. Human Rights 
Watch, based on Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency figures, observed 
that from April to July, 155 drug suspects were killedâa 50 percent 
increase from the number of suspects killed from December to March 
before the COVID-19 community quarantine.</p>
<p>The reported number of extrajudicial killings varied widely, as the 
government and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) used different 
definitions. The Commission on Human Rights, an independent government 
agency responsible for investigating possible human rights violations, 
investigated 157 new complaints of alleged extrajudicial or politically 
motivated killings involving 178 victims as of August; of the cases, 81 
involved drug-related extrajudicial killings with 93 victims. The 
commission suspected PNP or Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency 
involvement in 61 of these new complaints and armed forces or 
paramilitary personnel in seven cases.</p>
<p>Media reported continued attacks on human rights defenders. In August
 the human rights defender and former advocacy officer of the human 
rights NGO Karapatan, Zara Alvarez, was shot and killed in Bacolod City.
 Alvarez was included in a Department of Justice list of 600 individuals
 it intended to designate as terrorists. Karapatan said two other 
individuals on the list were also killed.</p>
<p>There was a widespread belief that police enjoyed impunity for 
killings, an accusation both the UN Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights and the Philippine Commission on Human Rights made in their
 reports in June and July, respectively. Many cases from previous years 
remained open. Of police officers involved in killings in the antidrug 
war since 2016, only three had been convicted of murderâall in 2018 for 
the 2017 murder of juvenile Kian delos Santos.</p>
<p>Civil society organizations accused police of planting evidence, 
tampering with crime scenes, unlawfully disposing of the bodies of drug 
suspects, and other actions to cover up extrajudicial killings. In June 
the National Bureau of Investigation charged two PNP members with 
planting evidence in the shooting of Winston Ragos, a former armed 
forces member suffering from mental illness, over an alleged COVID-19 
quarantine violation. The officers claimed that Ragos had reached for a 
firearm in his bag and reported that Ragos was found to be in possession
 of a .38 caliber pistol; however, the bureau concluded the officers had
 planted the pistol during the altercation.</p>
<p>Police were accused of murdering nine unarmed Muslim men in Kabacan 
on August 30. According to the Commission on Human Rights, one victim, 
before dying in hospital, told his family that police were behind the 
killings, and another made a call saying police had stopped him before 
being shot. Some observers on social media alleged police committed the 
killings to avenge the murder of a nearby villageâs police chief on 
August 24. Local police denied any involvement and initially suggested 
the incident was the result of a clan feud before a subsequent report 
alleged gunmen killed the victims after stopping them along the road. 
The government announced that a special task force would investigate in 
conjunction with the Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p>President Duterte continued to maintain lists of persons he claimed 
were suspected drug criminals, including government, police, military, 
and judicial officials. At least two elected officials on Duterteâs list
 were assassinated in 2020: Sultan Sumagka mayor Abdul Wahab Sabal in 
February and Santo Nino mayor Pablo Matinong in July. As of May, then 
national police chief Archie Gamboa had ordered investigations of 709 
police officers, including two police generals, named in the presidentâs
 lists. The national police reported four personnel were dismissed from 
service for actions related to their involvement in anti-illegal drug 
operations.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Disappearance</h3>

					
					<p>The armed forces Human Rights Office reported no cases of forced
 disappearance attributed to or implicating the forces from January to 
July. The Commission on Human Rights, however, reported three cases of 
abduction and forced disappearance from January to June, perpetrated by 
armed forces members in two instances and by national police members in 
the other. In June unidentified individuals in civilian clothing removed
 a woman from her home on Bantayan Island. According to the womanâs 
sister, who witnessed the event, they neither identified themselves nor 
said where they were taking the woman. When the abduction was reported 
to police, authorities said no police operations had been conducted that
 evening. The victim was an executive with an agricultural organization 
that the military had declared to be a front for the Communist Party of 
the Philippines (CPP)-New Peopleâs Army (NPA) in March 2019. The 
Commission on Human Rights opened an investigation, which stalled 
because of the local governmentâs COVID-related travel restrictions.</p>
<p>Kidnappings during the year were common and predominantly for 
criminal purposes (i.e., ransom); in the past they were carried out for 
both pro- and antigovernment political motives as well. Terrorist groups
 were implicated in many Mindanao kidnappings.</p>
<p>The law allows family members of alleged victims of disappearances to
 compel government agencies to provide statements in court about what 
they know regarding the circumstances surrounding a disappearance (or 
extrajudicial killing) and the victimâs status. Evidence of a kidnapping
 or killing requires the filing of charges, but in many past cases 
evidence and documentation were unavailable or not collected. 
Investigative and judicial action on disappearance cases was 
insufficient; a small number of previously reported cases were 
prosecuted.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits torture, and evidence obtained through its use
 is inadmissible in court. According to the Commission on Human Rights, 
however, members of the security forces and police were accused of 
routinely abusing and sometimes torturing suspects and detainees. Common
 forms of abuse during arrest and interrogation reportedly included 
electric shock, cigarette burns, and suffocation.</p>
<p>As of June the Commission on Human Rights had investigated 27 cases 
of alleged torture involving 34 victims; it suspected police involvement
 in 22 of the cases. The NGO Task Force Detainees of the Philippines 
monitored 16 torture cases from March to June, mostly for alleged 
COVID-19 quarantine violations. On March 20, the start of the COVID-19 
community quarantine, a village chief in Santa Cruz, Laguna, threatened 
to shoot five arrested curfew violators if they did not agree to be 
locked inside a dog cage for 30 minutes. On March 24, photographs of 
arrested curfew violators sitting on chairs in the middle of a 
basketball court and under the sun went viral after a village official 
from San Isidro, Paranaque, who posted the photographs, put a caption 
âEveryone caught violating the curfew, we will place here.â</p>
<p>NGOs and media reported local governments used psychological abuse, 
including shaming, as punishment for community quarantine curfew 
violators. Under the torture statutes, the public parading or shaming of
 a person is illegal when used to undermine a personâs dignity and 
morale. In April village officials in Pandacaqui, Pampanga, detained 
three members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex 
(LGBTI) community for curfew violations. The officials told the 
detainees to dance provocatively and kiss each other on the lips while 
being streamed live on Facebook.</p>
<p>Impunity was a significant problem in the security forces. Human 
rights groups continued to express concern about abuses committed by the
 national police and other security forces and noted little progress in 
reforms aimed at improving investigations and prosecutions of suspected 
human rights violations. The armed forces Human Rights Office monitored 
and reviewed alleged human rights abuses involving members of the 
military. From January through October, no extrajudicial killings, 
murders, or forced disappearances were identified or investigated by the
 office.</p>
<p>Human rights groups continued to express concern about the 
contribution of corruption to abuses committed by the national police 
and other security forces and noted little progress in implementing and 
enforcing reforms aimed at improving investigations and prosecutions of 
suspected human rights violations.</p>
<p>The national policeâs institutional deficiencies and the public 
perception that corruption in the police was endemic continued. The 
PNPâs Internal Affairs Service remained largely ineffective. In October 
the new PNP chief Cascolan reported 4,591 police officers were dismissed
 from service for serious violations, 7,888 were suspended, and 846 were
 demoted in rank, as part of the organizationâs internal cleansing 
program. Although the PNPâs Internal Affairs Service claimed manpower 
and resource limitations hampered its investigations into deaths 
resulting from police operations, it asserted the majority of police 
operations were legitimate, lawful police actions. The PNPâs 
Counter-Intelligence Task Force also monitored police personnel 
suspected of illegal activities.</p>
<p>From January to August, complainants reported five cases of alleged 
military and law enforcement involvement in human rights abuses to the 
Office of the Ombudsman, including killings, injuries, unlawful arrest, 
and torture. A majority of the cases were against low-ranking officials.
 As of October all cases remained open pending additional investigation.</p>
<p>Efforts continued to reform and professionalize the national police 
through improved training, expanded community outreach, and salary 
increases. Human rights modules were included in all national police 
career courses, and the police Human Rights Affairs Office conducted 
routine training nationwide on human rights responsibilities in 
policing. Several NGOs suggested that national police training courses 
should have a follow-up mechanism to determine the effectiveness of each
 session.</p>
<p>The armed forces Human Rights Office monitored and reviewed alleged 
human rights abuses involving members of the military. From January 
through July, the office identified and investigated no extrajudicial 
killings or murders or forced disappearances.</p>
<p>The military routinely provided human rights training to its members,
 augmented by training from the Commission on Human Rights. Successful 
completion of these courses is required to complete basic training and 
for induction, promotion, reassignment, and selection for foreign 
schooling opportunities. According to armed forceâs human rights office,
 internal human rights training is conducted from the general 
headquarters level down to battalion units, totaling hundreds of 
training exercise annually. From January to August, various military 
service units conducted human rights-related training programs, 
seminars, or workshops with the Commission on Human Rights, the 
International Committee of the Red Cross, and other NGOs.</p>
<p>The Congressional Commission on Appointments determines whether 
senior military officers selected for promotion have a history of human 
rights violations and solicits input from the Commission on Human Rights
 and other agencies through background investigations. The congressional
 commission may withhold a promotion indefinitely if it uncovers a 
record of abuses. Violations, however, do not preclude promotion.</p>
<p>Government mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption 
in the security forces were poorly resourced and remained largely 
ineffective. Potential witnesses often were unable to obtain protection.
 The Commission on Human Rights operated a small witness protection 
program that was overburdened by witnesses to killings in the antidrug 
campaign. The loss of family income due to the relocation of a family 
member was also, in some cases, a barrier to witnessesâ testimony. The 
Office of the Ombudsman also reported that witnesses often failed to 
come forward or to cooperate in police abuse or corruption cases. This 
problem sometimes followed pressure on witnesses and their families or 
arose from an expectation of compensation for their cooperation.</p>
<p>Reports of rape and sexual abuse of women in police or protective 
custody continued. In March, two national police officers were charged 
with sexual assault of two women detained at the Marikina City police 
station on drug charges. The women claimed that the officers raped them 
during interrogation and that they reported the rape to the duty jailor 
upon return to their detention cell. In October the national policeâs 
Women and Children Protection Center charged police Lieutenant Colonel 
Jigger Noceda with sexual assault for allegedly sexually assaulting 
former Ozamiz City vice mayor Nova Parojinog at least twice. Parojinog 
had been in police custody since 2017 on drug charges and was still 
awaiting a judgement in her case.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h3>

					
					<p>Prison conditions were often harsh and life threatening and 
included gross overcrowding, inadequate sanitary conditions, physical 
abuse, and a chronic lack of resources including medical care and food.</p>
<p>NGOs reported abuse by prison guards and other inmates was common, 
but they stated that prisoners, fearing retaliation, generally declined 
to lodge formal complaints.</p>
<p>The juvenile justice law exempts minors from criminal liability. Drug
 syndicates often used minors as runners, traffickers, cultivators, or 
drug den employees. Rescued minors are turned over to the custody of 
Department of Social Welfare and Development (social welfare 
department). Police stations had youth relations officers to ensure that
 authorities treated minor suspects appropriately, but in some cases 
they ignored procedural safeguards and facilities were not child 
friendly. The law mandates that the social welfare department provide 
shelter, treatment, and rehabilitation services to these children. From 
January to July, the department assisted 1,418 children in conflict with
 the law (that is, alleged as, accused of, or judged as having committed
 an offense) in 15 regional youth rehabilitation centers nationwide. 
Additionally, several local governments established and managed youth 
centers that provided protection, care, training, and rehabilitation for
 these children and other at-risk youth.</p>
<p><u></u>Physical Conditions: The Bureau of Corrections, under the 
Department of Justice, administered seven prisons and penal farms 
nationwide for individuals sentenced to prison terms exceeding three 
years. Bureau of Corrections facilities operated at almost four times 
their operating capacity of 11,981, holding 49,701 prisoners.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, under the Department of 
the Interior and Local Government and the national police, controlled 
470 city, district, municipal, and provincial jails that held pretrial 
detainees, persons awaiting final judgment, and convicts serving 
sentences of three years or less. The bureau reported its jails operated
 at 456 percent over designated capacity. The San Mateo municipal jail 
in Quezon City was one of the most congested jails in the country with 
an official capacity of 23 inmates; as of July it held 705 detainees. 
The Commission on Audit annual report for 2019, released in August, 
noted that jail congestion remained the biggest problem in the justice 
system and highlighted the most overcrowded Bureau of Jail Management 
and Penalogy (BJMP) detention centers: those in Zamboanga Peninsula (821
 percent over capacity), Metro Manila (645 percent), Central Visayas 
(611 percent), Calabarzon (513 percent), and Central Luzon (507 
percent). The audit commission stressed that, aside from health and 
sanitation problems, the jail congestion led to increased gang 
affiliation among inmates.</p>
<p>Despite an early initiative to put detention facilities on lockdown, 
overcrowding led to the spread of COVID-19 among inmates. From March 17 
to August 14, the government released 58,625 inmates to prevent COVID-19
 from spreading in the prison population, according to Supreme Court 
records. In July the Bureau of Corrections spokesperson reported 350 
inmates and personnel had contracted the virus, of whom 200 recovered, 
129 remained ill, and 21 died.</p>
<p>The Juvenile Justice and Welfare Council, an agency supervised by the
 Department of Justice, reported conditions in its rehabilitation 
centers (called Bahay Pag-asa or Houses of Hope) were worse than in 
jails, citing the lack of furniture such as beds and cabinets in some 
centers. There were 85 Bahay Pag-asa centers in the country, 82 run by 
local government units and three by NGOs.</p>
<p>Prison authorities did not uniformly enforce regulations that require
 holding male and female inmates in separate facilities and, in national
 prisons, overseeing them with guards of the same sex. In some 
facilities authorities did not fully segregate juveniles from adults. 
The prison services reported insufficient custodial and escort 
personnel, especially in large jails, with a national average of about 
55 prisoners assigned to each custodial staff member. In larger prisons 
the ratio was higher; for example, in the New Bilibid Prison, one prison
 guard oversaw 135 prisoners.</p>
<p>Poor sanitation, inadequate ventilation, poor access to natural 
lighting, and a lack of potable water were chronic problems in 
correctional facilities and contributed to health problems. From January
 to July, the prison services reported 1,069 total inmate deaths. The 
Bureau of Corrections attributed 31 of the 498 deaths in its facilities 
to COVID-19. Observers accused the Bureau of Corrections of using the 
virus to cover up the unlawful execution of inmates or inmate escapes.</p>
<p>Prison authorities reported that most deaths resulted from illness. 
Authorities provided Bureau of Corrections inmates with medical care; 
however, some medical services and treatments were not available. In 
such cases authorities referred inmates to an outside hospital. Inmates 
received a medicine allowance of 15 pesos ($0.28) per day.</p>
<p>Juveniles younger than 18 were typically released by court order or 
following a petition by the Public Attorneyâs Office, the inmateâs 
private lawyer, or through NGO-led appeals. As of July juveniles made up
 less than 1 percent of the prison population.</p>
<p>The juvenile justice law exempts minors from criminal liability. Drug
 syndicates often used minors as runners, traffickers, cultivators, or 
drug den employees. Rescued minors are turned over to the custody of 
Department of Social Welfare and Development (social welfare 
department). Police stations had youth relations officers to ensure that
 authorities treated minor suspects appropriately, but in some cases 
they ignored procedural safeguards and facilities were not child 
friendly. The law mandates that the social welfare department provide 
shelter, treatment, and rehabilitation services to these children. From 
January to July, the department assisted 1,418 children in conflict with
 the law (that is, alleged as, accused of, or judged as having committed
 an offense) in 15 regional youth rehabilitation centers nationwide. 
Additionally, several local governments established and managed youth 
centers that provided protection, care, training, and rehabilitation for
 these children and other at-risk youth.</p>
<p>Opportunities for prisoner recreation, learning, and self-improvement remained scarce.</p>
<p><u></u>Administration: Prisoners, their families, and lawyers may 
submit complaints to constitutionally established independent government
 agencies, and the Commission on Human Rights referred complaints it 
received to the appropriate agency.</p>
<p>Authorities generally allowed prisoners and detainees to receive 
visitors, but local NGOs reported that authorities periodically 
restricted family visits for some detainees accused of 
insurgency-related crimes. Prison officials noted that security concerns
 and space limitations at times also restricted prisoner access to 
visitors. Beginning in March the prison services suspended visits due to
 the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Muslim officials reported that while Muslim detainees could observe 
their religion, Roman Catholic mass was often broadcast by loudspeaker 
to prison populations of both Roman Catholic and non-Roman Catholic 
prisoners and detainees.</p>
<p><u></u>Independent <u></u>Monitoring: Authorities permitted 
international monitoring groups, including the International Committee 
of the Red Cross, free and timely access to jails and prisons. The 
constitution grants the Commission on Human Rights authority to visit 
jails, prisons, or detention facilities to monitor the governmentâs 
compliance with international treaty obligations. The commission 
reported some detention facilities lacked an understanding of its 
mandate and continued to deny their representatives access to detention 
facilities.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention and 
provides for the right of persons to challenge the lawfulness of their 
arrest or detention in court, and the government generally observed 
these requirements. As of August the Office of the Ombudsman, an 
independent agency responsible for investigating and prosecuting charges
 of public abuse and impropriety, did not receive any complaints of 
arbitrary detention committed by law enforcement agencies or the armed 
forces. There were, however, numerous credible allegations of arbitrary 
arrests and detentions by security forces.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>Warrants based on sufficient evidence and issued by an 
authorized official are required for an arrest unless the suspect is 
observed attempting to commit, in the act of committing, or just after 
committing an offense; there is probable cause based on personal 
knowledge that the suspect just committed an offense; or the suspect is 
an escaped prisoner. Authorities are required to file charges within 12 
to 36 hours for arrests made without warrants, depending on the 
seriousness of the crime. In terrorism cases the law permits warrantless
 arrests and detention without charges for up to 24 days, increased from
 three days with the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Act, signed into law 
in July.</p>
<p>Detainees have the right to bail, except when held for capital 
offenses or those punishable by a life sentence. The bail system largely
 functioned as intended, and suspects were allowed to appeal a judgeâs 
decision to deny bail. The law provides an accused or detained person 
the right to choose a lawyer and, if the suspect cannot afford one, to 
have the state provide one. An underresourced Public Attorneyâs Office, 
however, limited access of indigent persons to public defenders.</p>
<p><u></u>Arbitrary Arrest: Security forces continued to detain 
individuals, including juveniles, arbitrarily and without warrants on 
charges other than terrorism, especially in areas of armed conflict.</p>
<p>The Commission on Human Rights investigated 119 alleged illegal 
detention cases involving 306 victims from January to June. In a March 
case, police officers invited a human rights activist to their police 
station for a discussion. Upon arrival, officers photographed her with a
 piece of cardboard with a number and title, questioned her, and placed 
her in detention, where she remained as of October. The Commission on 
Human Rights visited the detained woman; however, the COVID-19 pandemic 
delayed further action.</p>
<p><u></u>Pretrial Detention: Lengthy pretrial detention remained a 
problem due largely to the slow and ineffectual justice system. 
Approximately 98 percent of prisoners in Bureau of Jail Management and 
Penology facilities were pretrial detainees; the balance were convicted 
criminals serving less than three-year sentences. Pending cases were not
 evenly distributed among the courts, which resulted in some severely 
overburdened courts. Large jails employed paralegals to monitor inmatesâ
 cases, prevent detention beyond the maximum sentence, and assist with 
decongestion efforts. The BJMP helped expedite court cases to promote 
speedy disposition of inmatesâ cases. Through this program authorities 
released 41,555 inmates from BJMP jails from January to July. 
Nonetheless, pretrial detention in excess of the possible maximum 
sentence was common, often extending over many years.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for an independent judiciary; although the 
government generally respected judicial independence, pressure, threats,
 and intimidation directed at the judiciary from various sources were 
reported by NGOs during the year. Six lawyers were killed as of July. 
Corruption through nepotism, personal connections, and sometimes bribery
 continued to result in relative impunity for wealthy or influential 
offenders. Insufficient personnel, inefficient processes, and long 
procedural delays also hindered the judicial system. These factors 
contributed to widespread skepticism that the criminal justice system 
delivered due process and equal justice.</p>
<p>Trials took place as a series of separate hearings, often months 
apart, as witnesses and court time became available, contributing to 
lengthy delays. There was a widely recognized need for more prosecutors,
 judges, and courtrooms. As of June 30, approximately one-third of 
authorized bench positions (563 positions) were unfilled. Sharia 
(Islamic law) court positions continued to be particularly difficult to 
fill because applicants must be members of both the Sharia Bar and the 
Integrated Bar. The 56 authorized district and circuit Sharia courts do 
not have criminal jurisdiction. Training for sharia court prosecutors 
was brief and considered inadequate.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court continued efforts to provide speedier trials, 
reduce judicial malfeasance, increase judicial branch efficiency, and 
raise public confidence in the judiciary. It continued to implement 
guidelines to accelerate resolution of cases in which the maximum 
penalty would not exceed six years in prison.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Trial Procedures</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for the right to a speedy, impartial, 
and public trial. Trials were generally public, but not timely, and 
judicial impartiality was widely questioned. The law requires that all 
persons accused of crimes be informed of the charges against them and 
grants rights to counsel, adequate time to prepare a defense, and a 
speedy and public trial before a judge. No criminal proceeding goes 
forward against a defendant without the presence of a lawyer. The law 
presumes defendants are innocent. They have the right to confront 
witnesses against them, be present at their trial, present evidence in 
their favor, appeal convictions, and not be compelled to testify or 
confess guilt. The court may appoint an interpreter if necessary. If the
 courtâs interpreter makes serious mistakes, a party may challenge the 
interpretation. The government generally implemented these requirements,
 except for the right to a speedy trial.</p>
<p>Although the law provides that cases should be resolved within three 
months to two years, depending on the court, trials effectively had no 
time limits. Government officials estimated it took an average of five 
to six years to obtain a decision.</p>
<p>Authorities respected a defendantâs right to representation by a 
lawyer, but poverty often inhibited access to effective legal counsel. 
The Public Attorneyâs Office, which reports to the Department of 
Justice, did not have the necessary resources to fulfill its 
constitutional mandate and used its limited resources to represent 
indigent defendants at trial rather than during arraignments or pretrial
 hearings. During pretrial hearings courts may appoint any lawyer 
present in the courtroom to provide on-the-spot counsel to the accused.</p>
<p>Sentencing decisions were not always consistent with legal guidelines, and judicial decisions sometimes appeared arbitrary.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-9" class="report__section-subtitle">Political Prisoners and Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>Under a 1945 law, the government defines political prisoners as 
those who may be accused of any crime against national security. Using 
this definition, the Bureau of Corrections reported 55 political 
prisoners in its facilities as of August. The Bureau of Jail Management 
and Penology does not track political prisoners and defines prisoners 
based only on security risk.</p>
<p>Various human rights NGOs maintained lists of incarcerated persons 
they considered political prisoners. Task Force Detainees of the 
Philippines, an NGO, tracked political detainees, most of whom were in 
pretrial detention. The task force noted that in the majority of cases, 
authorities mixed political prisoners with the general inmate 
population, except in the New Bilibid Prison, where they held most 
political prisoners in maximum-security facilities.</p>
<p>Three years after her arrest, during which prosecutors used a variety
 of legal tactics to delay arraignment, including filing new and 
amending previous charges, opposition senator Leila de Lima remained in 
police detention on a charge of conspiracy to commit drug trading. In 
May her political partyâthe Liberal Partyâcalled on police to allow de 
Lima to receive visitors and communicate with others, alleging that 
police held her incommunicado for a month using the threat of COVID-19 
as a pretext. The Liberal Party added that the COVID-19 pandemic must 
not prevent her âright to information, vital health services, and 
communication.â By June in-person contact with her legal team, family, 
and spiritual advisers was restored. In July, one of her accusers, a 
prison gang leader named Jaybee Sebastian, died in prison, reportedly of
 COVID-19. He claimed that he provided more than $200,000 in drug money 
to support de Limaâs 2016 senatorial campaign. De Limaâs case began in 
2016 after she opened hearings into killings related to the antidrug 
campaign. Although detained, de Lima had access to media and some 
visitors. Her case attracted widespread domestic and international 
attention, with many observers denouncing the charges as politically 
motivated.</p>
<p>The government permitted regular access to political prisoners by international humanitarian organizations.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-10" class="report__section-subtitle">Civil Judicial Procedures and Remedies</h3>

					
					<p>Most analysts regarded the judiciary as independent in civil 
matters. Complainants have access to local trial courts to seek civil 
damages for, or cessation of, human rights abuses. There are 
administrative as well as judicial remedies for civil complaints, 
although overburdened local courts often dismissed these cases. No 
regional human rights tribunals could hear an appeal from the country. 
Civil cases are subject to the same delays and corruption as criminal 
proceedings.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-11" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Arbitrary or Unlawful Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence</h3>

					
					<p>The government generally respected citizensâ privacy, although 
leaders of communist and leftist organizations and rural-based NGOs 
complained of routine surveillance and harassment. Authorities routinely
 relied on informant systems to obtain information on terrorist suspects
 and in the drug war. The reliability of information on illegal 
narcotics activities gained from these sources remained highly 
questionable. Although the government generally respected restrictions 
on search and seizure within private homes, searches without warrants 
continued. Judges generally declared evidence obtained illegally to be 
inadmissible.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-12" class="report__section-subtitle">g. Abuses in Internal Conflicts</h3>

					
					<p>For decades the country has contended with armed Muslim 
separatist movements represented by groups such as the Moro Islamic 
Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front; a communist 
insurgency supported by a nationwide NPA presence; and violence by 
smaller, transnational terrorist organizations, such as 
ISIS-Philippines, the Abu Sayyaf Group, the Maute Group, the Bangsamoro 
Islamic Freedom Fighters (hereafter Bangsamoro Front), and other 
terrorist groups and criminal syndicates. Additionally, interclan <i>rido</i> (feuds) violence continued in Mindanao, causing civilian deaths and displacement.</p>
<p><u></u>Killings: NGOs sometimes linked the killing of activists to 
the anti-insurgency operations by government security forces, 
particularly the military. For example, NGO Global Witness documented 43
 killings of environmental and land rights activists in 2019 and alleged
 security force involvement in some of the killings. On June 29, police 
in Jolo, Sulu, killed four soldiers who were reportedly pursuing Abu 
Sayyaf militants. A police report claimed the officers fired in 
self-defense while attempting to detain the soldiers for questioning, 
but army officials disputed those claims. The armed forces reported 
having killed 28 members of the Abu Sayyaf Group as of June.</p>
<p>Antigovernment groups attacked security force units, causing deaths. 
On August 15, for example, two soldiers were attacked and killed by 
armed communist rebels while guarding COVID-19 aid distribution on 
August 15. The NPA, ISIS-Philippines, Abu Sayaf Group, the Maute Group, 
Ansar al-Khalifa, the Bangsamoro Front, and other violent extremist 
groups used roadside bombs, ambushes, suicide bombings, and other means 
to kill political figures and other civilians, including persons 
suspected of being military and police informers. On August 24, two 
suicide bombers killed 11 persons and injured 24 in Jolo, Sulu. The 
first bombing targeted soldiers providing COVID-19 relief, while the 
second was detonated outside Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cathedral. The 
Islamic State claimed credit for the attack.</p>
<p>The NPA also menaced government offices and attacked or threatened 
businesses, power stations, farms, and private communication facilities 
to enforce collection of extortion payments, or so-called revolutionary 
taxes.</p>
<p><u></u>Abductions: Armed criminal and terrorist groups kidnapped 
civilians for ransom. The NPA and some separatist groups were also 
responsible for a number of arbitrary detentions and kidnappings. 
Through unofficial channels authorities reportedly facilitated ransom 
payments on behalf of victimsâ families and employers. The security 
forces at times attempted to rescue victims. A doctor held by the Abu 
Sayyaf Group in Sulu Province since February was rescued in March by an 
army-led rescue team.</p>
<p><u></u>Physical Abuse, Punishment, and Torture: Leftist and human 
rights activists continued to report harassment by local security 
forces, including abuse of detainees by police and prison officials.</p>
<p><u></u>Child Soldiers: The use of child soldiers, particularly by 
terrorist and antigovernment organizations, remained a problem, 
especially in some parts of Mindanao affected by low-intensity conflict.
 In the year to September, the national policeâs Women and Children 
Protection Center rescued 19 child soldiers from leftist-affiliated 
groups. There was no evidence of use or recruitment of child soldiers by
 government units. During the year the UN Office of the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict 
verified the recruitment and use of 18 children by armed groups, 
including Abu Sayyaf, the Bangsamoro Front, and the NPA. UNICEF 
monitored the recruitment and use of children in armed conflicts and the
 release of child soldiers. Government reporting mechanisms on child 
soldiers provided inconsistent data across agencies and regions, 
especially in conflict-affected areas, which made it difficult to 
evaluate the problemâs scale. The NPA continued to claim it did not 
recruit children as combatants but admitted that it recruited, trained, 
and used them for noncombat purposes, such as cooking.</p>
<p><u></u>Other Conflict-related Abuse: The armed forcesâ Human Rights 
Office claimed the NPAâs Weakened Guerilla Front 3 used 750 members of 
the Ata Manobo Tribe as human shields while operating in Kapalong, Davao
 del Norte, in March.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution explicitly provides for freedom of expression, 
including for the press, and the government sometimes respected this 
right. Government threats and actions against media outlets, 
journalists, and government critics continued, however, and polls 
suggested that most citizens considered it dangerous to publish 
information critical of the administration.</p>
<p><u></u>Freedom of <u></u>Speech: On the surface individuals could 
criticize the government publicly or privately and discuss matters of 
general public interest. Civil society organizations, however, stated 
that President Duterteâs public attacks on individuals and international
 bodies who criticized his policies continued to have a chilling effect 
on free speech and expression and that laws were increasingly misused 
against critics of his administration. Civil society organizations 
expressed concern that the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, signed into law 
on July 3, could be used to suppress speech, including through broad 
provisions against inciting terrorism. The Bayanihan to Heal As One Act,
 signed on March 24, punishes individuals for creating, perpetrating, or
 spreading false information about COVID-19 on social media and other 
platforms. Public officials continued to file criminal libel and cyber 
libel complaints against private citizens.</p>
<p>The armed conflict between the government and the NPA, the armed wing
 of the CPP, is more than a half-century old. The practice of accusing 
groups and individuals of having ties to the CPP-NPA, or red-tagging, 
increased significantly after the peace talks broke down in 2017 and 
President Duterte labeled the CPP-NPA a terrorist organization. 
According to human rights groups, red-tagging often involves government 
officials labeling human rights advocates, unions, religious groups, 
academics, and media organizations as âlegal frontsâ of the insurgency, 
allegedly to silence criticism of the government or intimidate opponents
 in local disputes. Leftist and human rights activists continued to 
report harassment by persons whom they suspected to be military or 
government agents, and some red-tagged activists were killed.</p>
<p><b><u></u></b>Freedom of <b><u></u></b>Press<b><u></u></b> and Media<b><u></u></b>, Including Online Media<b>:</b>
 Media generally remained active and expressed a wide variety of views 
without restriction, including criticism of the government, despite 
critical and threatening comments from political leadership, including 
the president.</p>
<p>Two major media outfits, however, faced outright restrictions and 
legal challenges: online news website Rappler and broadcast giant 
ABS-CBN. The president publicly called out both organizations for 
alleged wrongdoing: Rappler for its supposed reporting bias and foreign 
ownership, and ABS-CBN for a number of alleged crimes, including failure
 to show Duterteâs political advertisements during the 2016 presidential
 elections, violations of labor laws, foreign ownership, and financial 
irregularities. Reporters without Borders reported a âgrotesque judicial
 harassment campaignâ against Rappler and âthreats and intimidation by 
government agencies and institutions that support Duterteâ against 
ABS-CBN.</p>
<p>Rappler continued to be a target of substantial pressure, including 
legal and administrative actions, which some observers attributed to its
 critical coverage of the government. In June, Rappler CEO Maria Ressa 
and former researcher-writer Reynaldo Santos Jr. were found guilty of 
cyber libel over a 2012 Rappler story claiming the late Supreme Court 
justice Renato Corona used vehicles belonging to influential 
businessmen, including plaintiff Wilfredo Keng. Ressa and Santos posted 
bail and appealed the conviction. Keng filed a second cyber libel 
complaint against Ressa in February for her 2019 tweet of screenshots of
 a now deleted <i>Philippine Star</i> story linking the businessman to 
the murder of a former Manila councilor. The article at the heart of the
 original cyber libel complaint was published in May 2012. The 
cybercrime law was passed in September 2012, but the court concluded 
that the law still applied because Rappler updated the story in 2014 due
 to what Rappler claimed was a typographical error. The statute of 
limitations is also subject to contention (see Libel/Slander Laws 
below).</p>
<p>In July, in a nominally unrelated case, Ressa was arraigned on a tax 
evasion charge related to Rapplerâs issuance of Philippine depository 
receipts.</p>
<p>ABS-CBN was forced to stop television broadcasting on May 7 following
 a cease-and-desist order from the National Telecommunications 
Commission after the networkâs 25-year broadcast franchise license 
expired. The commission also issued two cease-and-desist orders against 
broadcasts on the media giantâs two other properties: ABS-CBN TV Plus 
and satellite service subsidiary Sky Direct. On July 10, a House of 
Representatives committee voted to deny ABS-CBNâs application for a new 
25-year franchise. A special technical working group created by the 
committee said ABS-CBNâs license did not merit renewal because of the 
companyâs supposed bias, failure to regularize employees, and the 
alleged dual citizenship of its chairman emeritus Eugenio âGabbyâ Lopez 
III. Several lawmakers filed resolutions seeking investigations into 
ABS-CBN, including the ownership of its 52,000-square-foot Manila 
headquarters, an alleged $32.5-million loan write-off from the 
Development Bank of the Philippines, and its block time agreement with 
Amcara Broadcasting Corporation. The network had reportedly laid off 
approximately 5,000 of its 11,000 employees by September due to the 
shutdown.</p>
<p><u></u>Violence and Harassment: Journalists continued to face 
harassment and threats of violence, including from politicians and 
government authorities critical of their reporting. A July survey from 
polling company Social Weather Stations showed that 51 percent of the 
countryâs residents agreed with the statement that âit is dangerous to 
print or broadcast anything critical of the administration, even if it 
is the truth.â</p>
<p>As of October the Committee to Protect Journalists, a press freedom 
NGO, reported that two journalists were killed during the year. On May 
5, unidentified gunmen killed radio journalist Cornelio Pepino in 
Dumaguete City. Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo had sued Pepino for
 defamation, but the radio anchor was acquitted.</p>
<p>A December 2019 report by the Freedom for Media, Freedom for All 
Network, a group of media NGOs and news organizations, also detailed the
 âunyielding reign of impunityâ since President Duterte took office. It 
said online journalists were the most attacked media group, followed by 
radio, print, and then television.</p>
<p>In December 2019 a local court handed down a landmark ruling on the 
2009 Maguindanao massacre, in which 32 journalists and 26 other persons 
died and which was dubbed by the Committee to Protect Journalists as the
 single deadliest international event for journalists in history. After 
10 years brothers Zaldy and Andal Ampatuan, Jr., along with 28 
coaccused, were found guilty of 57 counts of murder. As accessories to 
the crime, 15 others were convicted. The government continued to pursue 
approximately 80 suspects who remained at large.</p>
<p>In July the Catanduanes provincial legislature declared local radio 
anchor Ramil Soliveres persona non grata for posting about an unnamed 
council member missing a health committee hearing. During a speech the 
local official branded him a âfake newsâ media worker and called him a 
âmale prostituteâ while handing out topless photographs taken from the 
journalistâs personal Facebook account.</p>
<p>On September 14, two unidentified motorcycle-riding gunmen shot and 
killed television commentator Jobert Bercasio in Sorsogon City. Bercasio
 had reported on deforestation and illegal mining in the region and 
posted a Facebook photograph an hour before his death allegedly showing 
illegal mining at a local quarry.</p>
<p><u></u>Censorship or Content Restrictions: News organizations 
generally were spared censorship attempts, but media watchdogs noted 
several instances of alleged government interference.</p>
<p>With the nonrenewal of ABS-CBNâs franchise, the network was forced to
 move most of its programs online and close down its provincial 
television and radio stations and its current affairs division; the 
latter produced political shows and documentaries. Although the 
presidentâs office repeatedly distanced the president from the ABS-CBN 
shutdown, in a July 13 speech to troops in Jolo, he called out ABS-CBN 
again for allegedly ruining him. His communications team edited the 
video of the speech to remove any mention of the network, but netizens 
and journalists discovered the edit. President Duterte also attacked 
ABS-CBN and its owners during his 2020 state of the nation address.</p>
<p>In March the journalistsâ union denounced moves by the Presidential 
Communications Operations Office and its regional offices to require 
journalists to seek accreditation to cover the COVID-19 crisis even 
outside the Luzon quarantine area, calling it a âclear overstretch of 
the agencyâs authority.â</p>
<p>In July police officers confiscated and destroyed thousands of copies of the <i>Pinoy Weekly</i>
 magazine in Bulacan, calling it âillegalâ because it âteaches people to
 fight the government.â The journalistsâ union characterized it as a 
âclear example of dangers the Filipino people faceâ from the âvague 
provisionsâ of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020.</p>
<p><u></u>Libel<u></u>/Slander Laws: Laws stipulate criminal penalties 
for libel, which authorities used to harass, intimidate, and retaliate 
against journalists. The statute of limitations for libel in the revised
 penal code lapses after one year. In the case of Rappler, however, a 
local court and the Department of Justice stated the statute of 
limitations should be 12 years because it was âconsidered as a more 
serious offenseâ under the cyber libel law. Experts and legal groups 
such as the Concerned Lawyers Civil Liberties branded this ruling 
âunconstitutional.â</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Internet Freedom</h3>

					
					<p>With the exception of mobile communications blocked during 
special events for security purposes, the government did not restrict or
 disrupt access to the internet. While the government did not overtly 
censor online content, there were credible reports of government 
agencies and government-connected groups using coordinated, disguised 
online behavior to suppress speech critical of the government. On 
September 22, Facebook announced that it had dismantled several accounts
 for âcoordinated inauthentic behavior.â The fake accounts were 
allegedly operated by members of the military and police, with content 
largely revolving around criticism of the political opposition, 
activism, and communism. The military disputed at least one of the 
removals, claiming the site was a legitimate attempt to raise awareness 
of the communist movementâs recruiting tactics.</p>
<p>There were no credible reports that the government monitored private 
online communication without appropriate legal authority, but student 
protesters received threats of physical harm and other online attacks 
from progovernment supporters.</p>
<p>The Bayanihan Act punishes âindividuals or groups creating, 
perpetuating, or spreading false information regarding the COVID-19 
crisis on social media or other platformsâ that is âclearly geared to 
promote chaos, panic, anarchy, fear, or confusion.â Offenders face 
penalties of up to two months in prison or a substantial fine. Between 
March 9 and April 13, the PNPâs Anti-Cyber Crime Group recorded 24 cases
 of individuals allegedly sharing false information about the pandemic 
on social media. Legal groups expressed concern regarding local 
officials using vague provision on âfake newsâ in the emergency law. In 
April, Cebu artist Bambi Beltran was arrested without a warrant for 
posting a Facebook report about the rising number of COVID-19 cases in 
Cebu City. Cebu mayor Edgar Labella labeled her post as âfake news.â A 
Cebu court dismissed Beltranâs case in August for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>On July 16, the National Bureau of Investigation subpoenaed a college
 student for cyber libel for sharing an online post criticizing former 
Duterte aide and now senator Christopher Lawrence âBongâ Go. Observers 
accused government officials of selectively using the cyber libel laws 
to suppress free expression.</p>

					<p>There were no national government restrictions on academic 
freedom or cultural events; however, the government continued to close 
schools for indigenous Lumad people on Mindanao (see section 6, 
Indigenous People).</p>

					<p>The constitution provides for the freedoms of peaceful assembly 
and association, and the government generally respected these rights. 
Beginning in March, however, the government implemented restrictions on 
peaceful assembly in response to public health concerns related to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

					<p>Under Enhanced Community Quarantine rules, mass gatherings were 
prohibited. Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine rules permitted 
gatherings of up to five for religious reasons.</p>
<p>On April 1, residents gathered along EDSA highway in Quezon City when
 rumors spread that food and financial aid were to be distributed. When 
aid was not delivered, the group began to call on the government to 
provide assistance. NGOs alleged that police violently dispersed the 
peaceful gathering, arresting 21 individuals and holding them for five 
days on charges including âunlawful assemblyâ and ânoncooperation in a 
health emergency.â</p>
<p>On June 5, police arrested at least eight Anti-Terrorism Act 
protesters at the University of the Philippines Cebu under the 
provisions of the Law on Reporting of Communicable Diseases and the 
Public Assembly Act. On June 26, police dispersed an LGBT Pride protest 
against the Anti-Terrorism Act. Police arrested 20 demonstrators, 
charging them with offenses under same laws.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Freedom of Movement</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for freedom of internal movement, 
foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the government 
generally respected these rights. Beginning on March 16, however, the 
government imposed graduated quarantine measures restricting movement in
 response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><u></u>In-Country Movement: The most severe level of lockdown, 
Enhanced Community Quarantine, remained in place for two months 
throughout much of Luzon, until May 15. This prohibited individuals from
 using public transportation or traveling outside their homes except to 
perform necessary activities, such as purchasing food, essential work 
duties, or to seek medical care.</p>
<p><u></u>Foreign Travel: Government limits on foreign travel were 
generally based on security or personal safety factors, such as when a 
citizen had a pending court case, or to discourage travel by vulnerable 
workers to countries where they could face personal security risks, 
including trafficking or other exploitation. The Philippine Overseas 
Employment Administration manages departures for work abroad. It 
requires overseas workers to register and receive predeparture 
screening, training, and certification before traveling, and seeks to 
ensure that future overseas workers deal with legitimate, licensed 
recruitment agencies.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Status and Treatment of Internally Displaced Persons</h3>

					
					<p>Decades of sectarian and political insurgency, sporadic 
interclan fighting, and natural disasters have generated significant 
internal displacement. The number of internally displaced persons (IDPs)
 was uncertain and fluctuated widely. Counterinsurgency campaigns 
against the Abu Sayyaf Group, primarily in Sulu and Basilan Provinces, 
and clashes with the NPA, concentrated in the most geographically remote
 provinces, caused sporadic and small-scale displacement. Most IDPs were
 women and children.</p>
<p>In Mindanao the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
reported that as of August, more than 343,322 persons were displaced and
 in need of durable solutions, most of whom were located in the 
Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. Of those, approximately
 188,000 were displaced by natural disasters, 150,000 by armed conflict,
 6,600 by clan feuds, 4,600 by crime or violence, and 60,000 due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Government agencies, often with support from UN agencies and other 
international donors, provided food (although NGOs noted food aid was 
sometimes delayed); constructed shelters and public infrastructure; 
repaired schools; built sanitation facilities; offered immunization, 
health, and social services; and provided cash assistance and skills 
training for IDPs. The government permitted humanitarian organizations 
access to IDP sites. Security forces sometimes carried out military 
operations near IDP sites, increasing the risk of casualties and damage 
and restricting freedom of movement. Impoverished IDPs were highly 
susceptible to human trafficking networks.</p>
<p>At times the government encouraged IDPs to return home, but they were often reluctant to do so for security or welfare reasons.</p>

Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations 
in providing protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, 
refugees, returning refugees, asylum seekers, stateless persons, and 
other persons of concern.</p>
<p><u></u>Access to Asylum: No comprehensive legislation provides for 
granting refugee status or asylum. The Department of Justiceâs Refugee 
and Stateless Persons Protections Unit determines which applicants 
qualify as refugees in accordance with an established, accessible system
 that appeared to provide basic due process.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-10" class="report__section-subtitle">g. Stateless Persons</h3>

					
					<p>The Department of Justice is responsible for statelessness 
determinations of persons born in the country and of newly arrived 
persons. After an applicant files for a determination of statelessness, 
deportation or exclusion proceedings against the applicant and 
dependents are suspended, and the applicant may be released from 
detention. As of July, nine stateless persons were in the country, three
 of whom were classified as refugees and one as an asylum seeker.</p>
<p>Stateless persons may be naturalized. There were no known cases of 
social discrimination against stateless persons or limits on their 
access to public services.</p>
<p>The Philippine and Indonesian governments continued to hold bilateral
 meetings regarding an agreement on registering persons of Indonesian 
descent at risk of statelessness in Southern Mindanao. Of those 
registered, 96 percent had their citizenship confirmed as of December 
31, 2019.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides citizens the ability to choose their government
 by secret ballot in free and fair periodic elections based on universal
 and equal suffrage. Candidates, including for the presidency, 
frequently had their legal right to run for office challenged by 
political opponents based on alleged criminal history, citizenship, or 
other disqualifying conditions. These cases were sometimes pursued to 
the Supreme Court. Political candidates were allowed to substitute 
placeholders for themselves if unable to complete the registration 
process on time.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-3__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Elections and Political Participation</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Recent Elections: The country conducted nationwide 
midterm elections in May 2019 for national and local officials. 
International and national observers viewed the elections as well 
organized and generally free and fair, but they noted vote buying 
continued to be widespread and that dynastic political families 
continued to monopolize elective offices. The PNP reported 60 incidents 
of election-related violence that led to 23 killings in the month 
leading up to the election and on election day, a 55 percent drop in 
violent incidents compared with the 2016 national elections. Election 
officials described the polls as relatively peaceful. International 
Alert, however, reported 144 election-related incidents in the 
Bangsamoro region alone, mostly fistfights and small-scale bombings. 
President Duterteâs release of his ânarco-listâ ahead of the 2019 
midterms as a tool to defeat opposition candidates was of uncertain 
effect, as the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency confirmed that 25 of 
46 politicians on it won in the midterm polls.</p>
<p>Barangay and youth council elections were held in May 2018. On 
December 3, 2019, President Duterte signed into law a bill postponing 
the next barangay and youth council elections, previously scheduled for 
2021, to December 2022 to align the schedule with national elections.</p>
<p><u></u>Participation of Women and <u></u>Members of <u></u>Minorit<u></u>y Group<u></u>s:
 No laws limit participation of women or members of minority groups in 
the political process, and they did participate. At the national level, 
women constituted nearly 30 percent of the legislature. Participation by
 these groups did not change significantly compared with previous 
elections.</p>
<p>Men dominated the political scene, although the number of women 
holding elected positions in government rose after the 2019 elections. 
Media commentators expressed concern that political dynasties limited 
opportunities for female candidates not connected to political families.</p>
<p>There were no Muslim or indigenous Senate members, but there were 11 
Muslim members of the House of Representatives, mostly from 
Muslim-majority provinces, and at least three members of indigenous 
descent. Muslims, indigenous groups, and others maintained that electing
 senators from a nationwide list favored established political figures 
from the Manila area.</p>
<p>The law provides for a party-list system, designed to ensure the 
representation of marginalized and underrepresented sectors of society, 
for 20 percent of the seats in the House of Representatives.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-4" class="report__section-title">Section 4. Corruption and Lack of Transparency in Government</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for corruption by public 
officials, but the government did not implement these laws effectively, 
and officials frequently engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. 
Prolonged delays in the justice system reinforced the perception of 
impunity for the security forces and for national, provincial, and local
 government actors accused of corruption and human rights abuses.</p>
<p>President Duterte spoke frequently about his desire to fight 
corruption and fired public officials, including political allies, over 
allegations of corruption. In his July 27 state of the nation address, 
Duterte noted that even government COVID-19 assistance was not spared 
from corruption.</p>
<p><u></u>Corruption: To combat corruption, the constitution established
 the independent Office of the Ombudsman, an appellate-level 
anticorruption court, and the Commission on Audit. All three 
organizations were consistently allocated budgets below what they 
requested, but they actively collaborated with the public and civil 
society and appeared to operate independently and use their limited 
resources effectively. Despite government efforts to file charges and 
obtain convictions in a number of cases, officials continued to engage 
in corrupt practices with relative impunity.</p>
<p>Between January and July, the Office of the Ombudsman won 179 
convictions in 258 corruption cases. Although the total number of cases 
in this period was down by somewhat more than 50 percent, the conviction
 rate increased from 63 percent in the same period in 2019 to slightly 
more than 69 percent during the year.</p>
<p>In August a former Davao del Norte congressman was convicted and 
sentenced to six to eight years in prison for his role in an illegal 
land deal between his family business and the Bureau of Corrections. On 
August 27, former PhilHealth CEO Ricardo Morales resigned following 
investigations into widespread corruption in the agency. A whistleblower
 reported that PhilHealth executives perpetrated a 15-billion-peso 
($308,000) fraud misusing public funds, prompting formal investigations 
by the Senate, the House of Representatives, and an interagency task 
force. On October 2, the National Bureau of Investigation charged 
Morales and eight other senior PhilHealth officials with graft, 
malversation of public funds or property, and violations of the National
 Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p><u></u>Financial Disclosure: The law requires all public officials 
and employees to file, under oath, a statement of assets, liabilities, 
and net worth and to disclose their personal business interests and 
financial connections as well as those of their spouses and unmarried 
children living in their households. Nondisclosure is punishable by 
imprisonment not exceeding five years, a modest fine, or both, and, at 
the discretion of the court, disqualification from holding public 
office. The Civil Service Commission implements and enforces the law, 
forwarding nondisclosure cases to the Office of the Ombudsman for 
prosecution.</p>
<p>A former municipal mayor in Maguindanao was charged with dishonesty, 
neglect of duty, and five counts of failing to make certain disclosures 
in his financial statement. The former mayor was also allegedly included
 in the presidentâs list of politicians involved in illegal drug 
activities.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-5" class="report__section-title">Section 5. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Abuses of Human Rights</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A number of domestic and international human rights groups 
operated in the country, investigating and publishing their findings on 
human rights cases. Government officials were under pressure not to 
cooperate with or respond to the views of international human rights 
organizations. Local human rights activists continued to encounter 
occasional harassment, mainly from security forces or local officials 
from areas in which incidents under investigation occurred.</p>
<p>The Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates reported that 
during a UN Human Rights Council session in May, the Philippine 
delegation presented a list of local organizations allegedly affiliated 
with leftist groups including iDefend, a human rights movement 
established by the alliance to campaign against the governmentâs war on 
drugs and continuing impunity.</p>
<p><u></u>Government <u></u>Human Rights <u></u>Bodies: The Commission 
on Human Rightsâ constitutional mandate is to protect and promote human 
rights; investigate all human rights violations, including those 
reported by NGOs; and monitor government compliance with international 
human rights treaty obligations. Approximately three-quarters of the 
countryâs 42,000 villages had human rights action centers that 
coordinated with commission regional offices. Although the legislature 
doubled the commissionâs budget in the last two to three years, despite 
the executiveâs efforts to reduce it, the commission nonetheless lacked 
sufficient resources to investigate and follow up on all cases presented
 to its regional and subregional offices.</p>
<p>The Office of the Ombudsman is an independent agency that responds to
 complaints about public officials and employees. It has the authority 
to make administrative rulings and seek prosecutions.</p>
<p>The Presidential Human Rights Committee serves as a multiagency 
coordinating body on human rights problems. The committeeâs 
responsibilities include compiling the governmentâs submission for the 
UN Universal Periodic Review. Many NGOs considered it independent but 
with limited ability to influence human rights policy. The committee 
also chairs the Inter-Agency Committee on Extra-Legal Killings, Enforced
 Disappearances, Torture, and Other Grave Violations of the Right to 
Life, Liberty, and Security of Persons, also known as the AO35 
committee. This body determines the appropriate mechanisms to resolve 
cases of political violence. It inventories all cases of extrajudicial 
killings, enforced disappearances, torture, and other grave violations 
and classifies cases as unresolved, under investigation, under 
preliminary investigation, or under trial.</p>
<p>The Regional Human Rights Commission is a constitutionally mandated 
body tasked with monitoring alleged human rights violations in 
Bangsamoro.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">Women</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Rape and Domestic <u></u>Violence: Rape, including 
spousal rape, is illegal, with penalties ranging from 12 to 40 yearsâ 
imprisonment with pardon or parole possible only after 30 yearsâ 
imprisonment. Conviction can also result in a lifetime ban from 
political office. The law applies to both men and women. Penalties for 
forcible sexual assault range from six to 12 yearsâ imprisonment. The 
law criminalizes physical, sexual, and psychological harm or abuse to 
women (and children) committed by spouses, partners, or parents. 
Penalties depend on the severity of the crime and may include 
imprisonment or significant fines.</p>
<p>Authorities generally took reports of rape seriously. NGOs noted that
 in smaller localities perpetrators of abuse sometimes used personal 
relationships with local authorities to avoid prosecution.</p>
<p>Statistics were unavailable on prosecutions, convictions, and 
punishments for cases filed by the national police. Likewise, difficulty
 in obtaining rape convictions remained a challenge to effective 
enforcement. As of August the national policeâs Women and Children 
Protection Center recorded 4,207 cases of rape during the year, four 
times the number recorded during the same period of 2019, involving 
female and child victims. Of these, 1,735 were referred to prosecutors, 
and 1,885 were filed in court. The rest were either dropped, settled out
 of court, or dismissed. The national police filed and investigated 
2,464 rape cases during the COVID-19 community quarantine period from 
March 15 to July 31, a significant decrease in reported cases from the 
same period last year.</p>
<p>Domestic violence against women remained a serious and widespread 
problem. According to the national police, reported acts of domestic 
violence against women decreased from 10,976 in January to July 2019 
versus 6,512 for the same period during the year. Of the total, 3,745 
were filed during the community quarantine period from March 15 to July 
31. Local and international organizations observed alarming rise of 
cases of abuse against women and children during the community 
quarantine.</p>
<p>NGOs reported that cultural and social stigma deterred many women 
from reporting rape or domestic violence. NGOs reported that rape and 
sexual abuse of women in police or protective custody continued.</p>
<p>The national police and the Social Welfare Department both maintained
 help desks to assist survivors of violence against women and to 
encourage reporting. The national policeâs Women and Children Protection
 Center also operated a national hotline for reports of violence against
 women and children. In addition the social welfare department operated 
residential centers and community-based programs to assist women and 
children who were victims of rape, domestic violence, and other abuse. 
By the end of the second quarter, the department reported it had 
assisted 196 women and girls who were specifically victims of rape. With
 the assistance of NGOs, the Commission on Human Rights, and the 
Philippine Commission on Women, law enforcement officers continued to 
receive gender sensitivity training to deal with victims of sexual 
crimes and domestic violence. The national police maintained a women and
 childrenâs unit in approximately 1,800 police stations throughout the 
country with 2,167 help desks to deal with abuse cases. The national 
police assigned 5,482 officers to the desks nationwide, almost 98 
percent of them women. The law provides 10 days of paid leave for 
domestic violence victims.</p>
<p><u></u>Sexual <u></u>Harassment: The law prohibits sexual harassment,
 and violations are punishable by imprisonment from one to six months, a
 moderate fine, or both. Sexual harassment remained widespread and 
underreported, including in the workplace, due to victimsâ fear of 
losing their jobs.</p>
<p>The July 2019 Safe Streets and Public Spaces Act is intended to 
prevent and punish acts of sexual harassment in public places, online 
workplaces, and educational institutions. Despite the presidentâs 
support for it, local organizations observed that on multiple occasions 
his rhetoric in fact promoted violence against women. In a March report 
by the Center for Womenâs Resources, the organization recorded at least 
30 misogynistic remarks made by President Duterte, which the center 
described as encouraging violence against women.</p>
<p><u></u>Coercion in Population Control: There were no reports of 
coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization on the part of government 
authorities.</p>
<p><u></u>Discrimination: In law but not always in practice, women have 
most of the rights and protections accorded to men, and the law seeks to
 eliminate discrimination against women. The law accords women the same 
property rights as men. In Muslim and indigenous communities, however, 
property ownership law or tradition grants men more property rights than
 women.</p>
<p>No law mandates nondiscrimination based on gender in hiring, although
 the law prohibits discrimination in employment based on sex. 
Nonetheless, women continued to face discrimination on the job as well 
as in hiring.</p>
<p>The law does not provide for divorce. Legal annulments and separation
 are possible, and courts generally recognized divorces obtained in 
other countries if one of the parties was a foreigner. These options, 
however, are costly, complex, and not readily available to the poor. The
 Office of the Solicitor General is required to oppose requests for 
annulment under the constitution. Informal separation is common but 
brings with it potential legal and financial problems. Muslims have the 
right to divorce under Muslim family law.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Children</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Birth Registration: Citizenship derives from birth to a 
citizen parent and, in certain circumstances, from birth within the 
countryâs territory to alien parents. The government promoted birth 
registration, and authorities immediately registered births in health 
facilities. Births outside of facilities were less likely to be 
registered promptly, if at all. Updated estimates from the Philippine 
Statistics Authority on the number of unregistered children younger than
 age 14 were unavailable; however, NGOs continued to lobby Congress to 
make birth registration for children free. The lack of a birth 
certificate does not generally result in a denial of education or other 
services, but it may cause delays in some circumstances, for example if a
 minor becomes involved in the court system.</p>
<p><u></u>Education: Education is free and compulsory through age 18, 
but the quality of education was often poor and access difficult, 
especially in rural areas where substandard infrastructure makes 
traveling to school challenging. Supplemental costs, for supplies or 
uniforms, can in some cases be a barrier to students from poor families.
 The Department of Education continued to prioritize improving resources
 at and access to the most isolated schools, to include increasing the 
budget during the year for schools in the Bangsamoro, the region with 
the lowest rate of school attendance. According to the World Economic 
Forumâs 2020 Global Gender Gap Report, the primary school enrollment 
rate for girls was equal to the rate for boys, while the rate for girls 
was significantly higher than the rate for boys in secondary and 
tertiary schools.</p>
<p><u></u>Child Abuse: Child abuse remained a problem. Through the 
second quarter of the year, the social welfare department served only 
1,619 children in centers and residential care facilities nationwide, a 
small fraction of those in need. Several cities ran crisis centers for 
abused women and children.</p>
<p><u></u>Child, <u></u>Early<u></u>,<u></u> and <u></u>Forced <u></u>Marriage:
 The legal minimum age for marriage for both sexes is 18 years; anyone 
younger than 21 must have parental consent. Under Muslim personal law, 
Muslim boys may marry at 15, and girls may marry when they reach 
puberty.</p>
<p><u></u>Sexual Exploitation of Children: The law prohibits the 
commercial exploitation of children and child pornography and defines 
purchasing commercial sex acts from a child as a trafficking offense. 
The statutory rape law criminalizes sex with minors younger than 12 and 
sex with a child younger than 18 involving force, threat, or 
intimidation. The maximum penalty for child rape is 40 years in prison 
plus a lifetime ban from political office. The production, possession, 
and distribution of child pornography are illegal, and penalties range 
from one month to life in prison, plus significant fines, depending on 
the gravity of the offense.</p>
<p>While authorities endeavored to enforce the law, inadequate 
prosecutorial resources and capacity to analyze computer evidence were 
challenges to effective enforcement. The government made serious efforts
 to address these crimes and collaborated with foreign law enforcement, 
NGOs, and international organizations.</p>
<p>Despite the penalties, law enforcement agencies and NGOs reported 
that criminals and family members continued to use minors in the 
production of pornography and in cybersex activities.</p>
<p>Children continued to be victims of sex trafficking, and the country 
remained a destination for foreign and domestic child sex tourists. 
Additionally, the live internet broadcast of young girls, boys, and 
sibling groups performing sex acts for paying foreigners continued. The 
government continued to prosecute accused pedophiles and deport those 
who were foreigners and to stop the entry of identified convicted sex 
offenders. To reduce retraumatization of child victims and spare 
children from having to testify, the government increased its use of 
plea agreements in online child sexual exploitation cases, which 
significantly reduced the case disposition time.</p>
<p>In June the national police arrested a woman for the online sex 
trafficking of her adult deaf sister and six children ages two to 15, 
including the womanâs son and two nieces. Police rescued the victims 
from the trafficker and provided them with trauma therapy and shelter 
placement. In September a woman pled guilty to attempted trafficking. In
 a sting police caught the woman exploiting her two sisters and 
six-year-old daughter. The government used plea bargains and 
technology-based child-protective measures to prevent retraumatization.</p>
<p>The National Bureau of Investigation and the PNP worked closely with 
the Labor Department to target and close facilities suspected of sex 
trafficking of minors. Since the start of the COVID-19 community 
quarantine period from March to May, the Department of Justiceâs Office 
of Cybercrime reported 279,166 cases of online sexual exploitation of 
children, a 265 percent increase from the same period in 2019.</p>
<p><u></u>Displaced Children: While there were no recent, reliable data,
 involved agencies and organizations agreed there were hundreds of 
thousands of street children in the country. The problem was endemic 
nationwide and encompassed local children and the children of IDPs, 
asylum seekers, and refugees. Many street children were involved in 
begging, garbage scavenging, and petty crime.</p>
<p>Service agencies, including the social welfare department, provided 
residential and community-based services to thousands of street children
 nationwide, including in a limited number of residential facilities and
 the growing Comprehensive Program for Street Children, Street Families,
 and Indigenous Peoples. This program included activity centers, 
education and livelihood aid, and community service programs.</p>
<p><u></u>International Child Abductions: The country is a party to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs <i>Annual Report</i><i> on </i><i>International Parental Child Abduction</i> at <a class="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210331000812/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data/reported-cases.html" target="_self"> <span class="external-link-title">https://

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Persons with Disabilities</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution prohibits discrimination against persons with 
physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities. The law aims 
to provide affordable and accessible mental health services and provide 
for equal access for persons with disabilities to all public buildings 
and establishments.</p>
<p>The National Council for Disability Affairs formulated policies and 
coordinated the activities of government agencies for the 
rehabilitation, self-development, and self-reliance of persons with 
disabilities and their integration into the mainstream of society.</p>
<p>The law was not effectively enforced, and many barriers remained for 
persons with disabilities. Advocates for persons with disabilities 
contended that equal access laws were ineffective due to weak 
implementing regulations, insufficient funding, and inadequately focused
 integrative government programs. The great majority of public buildings
 remained inaccessible to persons with physical disabilities. Many 
schools had architectural barriers that made attendance difficult for 
persons with disabilities. Government efforts to improve access to 
transportation for persons with disabilities were limited.</p>
<p>Persons with disabilities continued to face discrimination and other challenges in finding employment (see section 7.d.).</p>
<p>Some children with disabilities attended schools in mainstream or 
inclusive educational settings. The Department of Educationâs 648 
separate special education centers did not provide nationwide coverage, 
and the government lacked a clear system for informing parents of 
children with disabilities of their educational rights and did not have a
 well defined procedure for reporting discrimination in education.</p>
<p>From January to August, the social welfare department provided 
services to 1,306 persons with disabilities in assisted living centers 
and community-based vocational centers nationwide, a small fraction of 
the population in need. If a person with disabilities suffered violence,
 access to after-care services might be available through the social 
welfare department, crisis centers, and NGOs. Of local government units,
 60 percent had a persons with disability office to assist in accessing 
services including health, rehabilitation, and education.</p>
<p>The constitution provides for the right of persons with physical 
disabilities to vote. The Commission on Elections determines the 
capacity of persons with mental disabilities to vote during the 
registration process, and citizens may appeal exclusions (and 
inclusions) in court. A federal act authorizes the commission to 
establish accessible voting centers exclusively for persons with 
disabilities and senior citizens.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Indigenous People</h3>

					
					<p>Although no specific laws discriminate against indigenous 
people, the geographical remoteness of the areas many inhabit and 
cultural bias prevented their full integration into society. Indigenous 
children often suffered from lack of health care, education, and other 
basic services. Government officials indicated approximately 80 percent 
of the countryâs government units complied with the longstanding legal 
requirement that indigenous peoples be represented in policy-making 
bodies and local legislative councils.</p>
<p>Fifty-five schools for Lumad children that the Department of 
Education closed in 2019 for alleged deviations from the basic 
curriculum remained closed as of August. In that same period, the 
government closed 176 of the 216 tribal schools in the southern part of 
the country in what the Save Our Schools Network, a group of childrenâs 
rights NGOs, called âcontinuing attacks on tribal schools.â</p>
<p>The National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, a government agency 
staffed by tribal members, was responsible for implementing 
constitutional provisions to protect indigenous peoples. It has 
authority to award certificates identifying âancestral domain landsâ 
based on communal ownership, thereby stopping tribal leaders from 
selling the land. Indigenous rights activist groups criticized the 
indigenous peoplesâ commission, noting that it approved projects on 
ancestral lands without the free, prior, and informed consent required 
by law.</p>
<p>Armed groups frequently recruited from indigenous populations. 
Indigenous peoplesâ lands were also often the site of armed encounters 
related to resource extraction or intertribal disputes, which sometimes 
resulted in displacement or killings.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">Acts of Violence, Criminalization, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h3>

					
					<p>National laws neither criminalize consensual same-sex sexual 
conduct among adults nor prohibit discrimination based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity. Eighteen cities, six provinces, three 
barangays, and one municipality had enacted a version of an 
antidiscrimination ordinance that protects lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
transgenderâbut not intersexârights.</p>
<p>Officials prohibit transgender individuals from obtaining passports 
that reflect their gender identity. Authorities print the gender at 
birth, as reported on the birth certificate, in the individualâs 
passport, which posed difficulty for transgender persons seeking to 
travel, such as instances of transgender individuals being denied 
boarding on aircraft.</p>
<p>NGOs reported incidents of discrimination and abuse against LGBTI 
persons, including in employment, education, health care, housing, and 
social services. In June, Manila police arrested 20 Pride protesters for
 violating health safety protocols during the nationwide community 
quarantine. Some of those arrested reported they experienced 
discrimination while in detention.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the rights of workers, with the exception 
of the military, police, short-term contract employees, and some foreign
 workers, to form and join independent unions, bargain collectively, and
 conduct strikes; it prohibits antiunion discrimination. The law, 
however, places several restrictions on these rights.</p>
<p>Laws and regulations provide for the right to organize and bargain 
collectively in both the private sector and corporations owned or 
controlled by the government. The law prohibits organizing by foreign 
national or migrant workers unless a reciprocity agreement exists with 
the workersâ countries of origin specifying that migrant workers from 
the Philippines are permitted to organize unions there. The law also 
bars temporary or outsourced workers and workers without employment 
contracts from joining a union. The law requires the participation of 20
 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit where the union seeks 
to operate; the International Labor Organization (ILO) called this 
requirement excessive. The scope of collective bargaining in the public 
sector is limited to a list of terms and conditions of employment 
negotiable between management and public employees. These are items 
requiring appropriation of funds, including health care and retirement 
benefits; items involving the exercise of management prerogatives, 
including appointment, promotion, compensation structure, and 
disciplinary action, are nonnegotiable.</p>
<p>For a private-sector strike to be legal, unions must provide advance 
strike notice (30 days for issues associated with collective bargaining 
and 15 days for issues regarding unfair labor practices), respect 
mandatory cooling-off periods, and obtain approval from a majority of 
members. The Department of Labor and Employmentâs National Conciliation 
and Mediation Board reported 199 mediation-conciliation cases from 
January to July. Of these, 148 cases were filed under preventive 
mediation, 47 under notices of strike or lockout, and four under actual 
strike or lockout. The National Conciliation and Mediation Board 
attributed the decrease of filed cases to the COVID-19 pandemic and 
community quarantine.</p>
<p>The law subjects all problems affecting labor and employment to 
mandatory mediation-conciliation for one month. The Labor Department 
provides mediation services through a board, which settles most unfair 
labor practice disputes. Through the National Conciliation and Mediation
 Board, the department also works to improve the functioning of 
labor-management councils in companies with unions.</p>
<p>If mediation fails, the union may issue a strike notice. Parties may 
bring any dispute to mediation, but strikes or lockouts must be related 
to acts of unfair labor practice, a gross violation of collective 
bargaining laws, or a collective bargaining deadlock. The law provides 
for a maximum prison sentence of three years for participation in an 
illegal strike, although there has never been such a conviction. The law
 also permits employers to dismiss union officers who knowingly 
participate in an illegal strike.</p>
<p>The law prohibits government workers from joining strikes under the 
threat of automatic dismissal. Government workers may file complaints 
with the Civil Service Commission, which handles administrative cases 
and arbitrates disputes. Government workers may also assemble and 
express their grievances on the work premises during nonworking hours.</p>
<p>The secretary of the Labor Department, and in certain cases the 
president, may intervene in labor disputes by assuming jurisdiction and 
mandating a settlement if either official determines that the 
strike-affected company is vital to the national interest. Vital sectors
 include hospitals, the electric power industry, water supply services 
(excluding small bottle suppliers), air traffic control, and other 
activities or industries as recommended by the National Tripartite 
Industrial Peace Council. Labor rights advocates continued to criticize 
the government for maintaining definitions of vital services that were 
broader than international standards.</p>
<p>By law antiunion discrimination, especially in hiring, is an unfair 
labor practice and may carry criminal or civil penalties that were not 
commensurate with analogous crimes (although generally civil penalties 
were favored over criminal penalties).</p>
<p>In most cases the government respected freedom of association and 
collective bargaining and enforced laws protecting these rights. The 
Department of Labor has general authority to enforce laws on freedom of 
association and collective bargaining. The National Labor Relations 
Commissionâs labor arbiter may also issue orders or writs of execution 
for reinstatement that go into effect immediately, requiring employers 
to reinstate the worker and report compliance to it. Allegations of 
intimidation and discrimination in connection with union activities are 
grounds for review by the quasi-judicial commission, as they may 
constitute possible unfair labor practices. If there is a definite 
preliminary finding that a termination may cause a serious labor dispute
 or mass layoff, the labor department secretary may suspend the 
termination and restore the status quo pending resolution of the case.</p>
<p>Penalties under the law for violations of freedom of association or 
collective bargaining laws were generally not commensurate with similar 
crimes. Administrative and judicial procedures were subject to lengthy 
delays and appeals.</p>
<p>The tripartite industrial peace council serves as the main 
consultative and advisory mechanism on labor and employment for 
organized labor, employers, and government on the formulation and 
implementation of labor and employment policies. It also acts as the 
central entity for monitoring recommendations and ratifications of ILO 
conventions. The Labor Department, through the industrial peace council,
 is responsible for coordinating the investigation, prosecution, and 
resolution of cases alleging violence and harassment of labor leaders 
and trade union activists pending before the ILO.</p>
<p>Workers faced several challenges in exercising their rights to 
freedom of association and collective bargaining. Some employers 
reportedly chose to employ workers who could not legally organize, such 
as short-term contract and foreign national workers, to minimize 
unionization and avoid other rights accorded to âregularâ workers. The 
nongovernmental Center for Trade Union and Human Rights contended that 
this practice led to a decline in the number of unions and workers 
covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employers also often abused
 contract labor provisions by rehiring employees shortly after the 
expiration of the previous contract. The Labor Department reported 
multiple cases of workers alleging employers refused to bargain.</p>
<p>Unions continued to claim that local political leaders and officials 
who governed the Special Economic Zones explicitly attempted to 
frustrate union organizing efforts by maintaining union-free or 
strike-free policies. Unions also claimed the government stationed 
security forces near industrial areas or Special Economic Zones to 
intimidate workers attempting to organize and alleged that companies in 
the zones used frivolous lawsuits to harass union leaders. Local zone 
directors claimed exclusive authority to conduct their own inspections 
as part of the zonesâ privileges intended by the legislature. Employers 
controlled hiring through special zone labor centers. For these reasons,
 and in part due to organizersâ restricted access to the closely guarded
 zones and the propensity among zone establishments to adopt fixed term,
 casual, temporary, or seasonal employment contracts, unions had little 
success organizing in the Special Economic Zones. The Labor Department 
does not have data on compliance with labor standards in the zones.</p>
<p>Harassment of union members continued. In April workers at a 
Coca-Cola plant in Laguna said unidentified armed men threatened them, 
took them to a military camp, and forced them to admit they were members
 of the NPA. In August workers at an aluminum factory in Valenzuela 
claimed that soldiers entered the plant and demanded the name of their 
union head.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor. 
Although legal penalties are commensurate with similar crimes, the 
government did not effectively enforce the law.</p>
<p>The government continued awareness-raising activities, especially in 
the provinces, in an effort to prevent forced labor. The Labor 
Departmentâs efforts included an orientation program for recruits for 
commercial fishing vessels, who were among the workers most vulnerable 
to forced labor conditions.</p>
<p>Reports of forced labor by adults and children continued, mainly in 
fishing and other maritime industries, small-scale factories, gold 
mines, domestic service, agriculture, and other areas of the informal 
sector (see section 7.c.). According to NGOs and survivors, unscrupulous
 employers subjected women from rural communities and impoverished urban
 centers to domestic service, forced begging, and forced labor in small 
factories. They also subjected men to forced labor and debt bondage in 
agriculture, including on sugar cane plantations and in fishing and 
other maritime industries. Trade unions reported that continued poor 
compliance with the law was due in part to the governmentâs lack of 
capacity to inspect labor practices in the informal economy.</p>
<p>There were reports some persons who voluntarily surrendered to police
 and local government units in the violent antidrug campaign were forced
 to do manual labor or other activities that could amount to forced 
labor without charge, trial, or finding of guilt under law. Inmates are 
only allowed to perform manual labor within prisons at the inmatesâ 
request.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits employing children younger than age 15, 
including for domestic service, except under the direct and sole 
responsibility of parents or guardians, and sets the maximum number of 
working hours for them at four hours per day and no more than 20 hours 
per week. The law also prohibits the worst forms of child labor. 
Children between 15 and 17 are limited to eight working hours per day, 
up to a maximum of 40 hours per week. The law forbids the employment of 
persons younger than 18 in hazardous work. The minimum age for work is 
lower than the compulsory education age, enticing some children to leave
 school before the completion of their compulsory education.</p>
<p>The government did not effectively enforce the law. Although the 
government imposed fines and instituted criminal prosecutions for child 
labor law violations in the formal sector, for example in manufacturing,
 it did not do so effectively or consistently. Fines for child labor law
 violations were not commensurate with analogous crimes. From January to
 July, the Labor Department, through its Sagip Batang Manggagawa (Rescue
 Child Laborers) program (part of the Health, Education, Livelihood, and
 Prevention, Protection, and Prosecution, Monitoring and Evaluation 
Convergence Program), conducted four operations and removed five minors 
from hazardous and exploitative working conditions. As of July the 
department closed two establishments for violations of child labor laws.
 Operations under the Sagip Batang Manggagawa program are conducted and 
concluded separately from the standard labor inspection process.</p>
<p>The government, in coordination with domestic NGOs and international 
organizations, continued to implement programs to develop safer options 
for children, return them to school, and offer families viable economic 
alternatives to child labor. The Labor Department continued its efforts 
to reduce the worst forms of child labor and to remove children from 
hazardous work under the Convergence Program. Inspections as of October 
found eight establishments employing 39 minors. Four of the eight 
establishments were found to have violated the Anti-Child Labor Law; two
 were immediately corrected, and two were filed in courts.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, child labor remained a widespread problem. 
Previous cases reported to the Labor Department focused on domestic 
services and agricultural sectors, notably in the fishing, palm oil, and
 sugar cane industries. Most child labor occurred in the informal 
economy, often in family settings. Child workers in those sectors and in
 activities such as gold mining, manufacturing (including of fireworks),
 domestic service, drug trafficking, and garbage scavenging faced 
exposure to hazardous working environments.</p>
<p>NGOs and government officials continued to report cases in which 
family members sold children to employers for domestic labor or sexual 
exploitation.</p>
<p>Online sexual exploitation of children and child soldiering also 
continued to be a problem (see sections 6 and 1.g., respectively).</p>
<p>Also see the Department of Laborâs <i>Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor</i> at <a class="external-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210331000812/https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/findings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span class="external-link-title">https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/findings</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination with respect to employment and 
occupation based on age, sex, race, creed, disability, HIV or 
tuberculosis or hepatitis B status, or marital status. The law does not 
prohibit employment discrimination with respect to color, political 
opinion, national origin or citizenship, language, sexual orientation, 
gender identity, other communicable disease status, or social origin. 
While some local antidiscrimination ordinances exist at the municipal or
 city levels that prohibit employment discrimination against lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, and transgenderâbut not intersexâpersons, there was no 
prohibition against such discrimination in national legislation.</p>
<p>The law requires most government agencies and government-owned 
corporations to reserve 1 percent of their positions for persons with 
disabilities; government agencies engaged in social development must 
reserve 5 percent. The law commits the government to providing 
âsheltered employmentâ to persons with disabilities, for example in 
workshops providing separate facilities. The Labor Departmentâs Bureau 
of Local Employment maintained registers of persons with disabilities 
that indicated their skills and abilities and promoted the establishment
 of cooperatives and self-employment projects for such persons.</p>
<p>Persons with disabilities nonetheless experienced discrimination in 
hiring and employment. The Labor Department estimated that only 10 
percent of employable persons with disabilities were able to find work. 
Between January and July, no cases were filed to enforce the law. The 
government did not effectively monitor laws prohibiting employment 
discrimination or promoting the employment of persons with disabilities.
 Penalties were commensurate with other crimes.</p>
<p>The government had limited means to assist persons with disabilities 
in finding employment, and the cost of filing a lawsuit and lack of 
effective administrative means of redress limited the recourse of such 
persons when prospective employers violated their rights.</p>
<p>Discrimination in employment and occupation against LGBTI persons 
occurred; a number of LGBTI organizations submitted anecdotal reports of
 discriminatory practices that affected the employment of LGBTI persons.
 Discrimination cases included the enforcement of rules, policies, and 
regulations that disadvantaged LGBTI persons in the workplace.</p>
<p>Women faced discrimination both in hiring and on the job. Some labor 
unions claimed female employees suffered punitive action when they 
became pregnant. Although women faced workplace discrimination, they 
occupied positions at all levels of the workforce.</p>
<p>Women and men were subject to systematic age discrimination, most notably in hiring.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>Official minimum wages were below the poverty line. By law the 
standard workweek is 48 hours for most categories of industrial workers 
and 40 hours for government workers, with an eight hour per day limit. 
The law mandates one day of rest each week. The government mandates an 
overtime rate of 125 percent of the hourly rate on ordinary days, 130 
percent on special nonworking days, and 200 percent on regular holidays.
 There is no legal limit on the number of overtime hours that an 
employer may require.</p>
<p>The law did not cover many workers, since wage boards exempted some 
newly established companies and other employers from the rules because 
of factors such as business size, industry sector, export intensity, 
financial distress, and capitalization level.</p>
<p>Domestic workers worked under a separate wage and benefit system, 
which lays out minimum wage requirements and payments into social 
welfare programs, and mandates one day off a week. While there were no 
reliable recent data, informed observers believed two million or more 
persons were employed as domestic workers, with nearly 85 percent being 
women or girls as young as age 15.</p>
<p>Penalties for noncompliance with increases or adjustments in 
mandatory minimum wage rates are modest fines, imprisonment of one to 
two years, or both. In addition to fines, the government used 
administrative procedures and moral persuasion to encourage employers to
 rectify violations voluntarily. The penalties were commensurate with 
similar crimes. The government did not effectively enforce minimum wage 
laws. Violations of minimum wage standards were common. Many firms hired
 employees for less than minimum wage apprentice rates, even if there 
was no approved training in their work. Complaints about payment under 
the minimum wage and nonpayment of social security contributions and 
bonuses were particularly common at companies in the Special Economic 
Zones.</p>
<p>The law provides for a comprehensive set of appropriate occupational 
safety and health standards. Regulations for small-scale mining, for 
example, prohibit certain harmful practices, including the use of 
mercury and underwater, or compressor, mining. The law provides for the 
right of workers to remove themselves from situations that endangered 
health or safety without jeopardy to their employment. Most labor laws 
apply to foreign workers, who must obtain work permits and may not 
engage in certain occupations.</p>
<p>The Labor Departmentâs Bureau of Working Conditions monitors and 
inspects compliance with labor law in all sectors, including workers in 
the formal and informal sectors, nontraditional laborers, as well as 
inspects Special Economic Zones and businesses located there. The number
 of labor law compliance officers, who monitor and enforce the law, 
including by inspecting compliance with core labor and occupational 
safety standards and minimum wages, was insufficient for the workforce 
of 42 million, particularly in rural areas. The Labor Department 
prioritized increasing the number of officers while acknowledging that 
insufficient inspection funds continued to impede its ability to 
investigate labor law violations effectively, especially in the informal
 sector and in small and medium-size enterprises.</p>
<p>The Labor Department continued to implement its Labor Laws Compliance
 System for the private sector. The system included joint assessments, 
compliance visits, and occupational safety and health standards 
investigations. Labor department inspectors conducted joint assessments 
with employer and worker representatives; inspectors also conducted 
unannounced compliance visits and occupational safety and health 
standards investigations. The Labor Department and the ILO also 
continued to implement an information management system to capture and 
transmit data from the field in real time using mobile technology. 
Violations from January to July dropped significantly from the same 
period in 2019 because of COVID-19 quarantine restrictions, with 3,678 
for general labor standards, 1,457 for violations of minimum wage rates,
 and 6,908 for occupational safety and health standards. Following a 
deficiency finding, the Labor Department may issue compliance orders 
that can include a fine or, if the deficiency poses a grave and imminent
 danger to workers, suspend operations. Penalties were commensurate with
 those for similar crimes. The Labor Departmentâs Bureau of Working 
Conditions did not close any establishments during the year. Such 
closures require prior notification and hearings.</p>
<p>During the year various labor groups criticized the governmentâs 
enforcement efforts, in particular the Labor Departmentâs lax monitoring
 of occupational safety and health standards in workplaces. Between 
January and July, the Bureau of Working Conditions recorded 46 
work-related accidents that caused 26 deaths and 2 injuries. Statistics 
on work-related accidents and illnesses were incomplete, as incidents 
were underreported, especially in agriculture.</p>
<p>A labor department order sets guidelines on the use of labor 
contracting and subcontracting. Some labor unions, however, criticized 
the order for not ending all forms of contractual work.</p>
<p>There were also gaps in the law, and the government enforced it 
inconsistently. Media reported, for example, problems in the 
implementation and enforcement of the domestic workerâs law, including a
 tedious registration process, an additional financial burden on 
employers, and difficulty in monitoring employer compliance.</p>
<p>The government and several NGOs worked to protect the rights of the 
countryâs overseas citizens, most of whom were Philippine Overseas 
Employment Agency contract or temporary workers. Although the agency 
registered and supervised domestic recruiter practices, authorities 
often lacked sufficient resources to provide complete worker protection 
overseas. The Overseas Worker Welfare Administration provides support to
 overseas workers in filing grievances against employers via its legal 
assistance fund. The fund covers administrative costs that would 
otherwise prevent overseas workers from filing grievance complaints. 
Covered costs include fees for court typing and translation, visa 
cancellation, and contract termination.</p>
<p>The government continued to place financial sanctions on, and bring 
criminal charges against, domestic recruiting agencies found guilty of 
unfair labor practices.</p>
