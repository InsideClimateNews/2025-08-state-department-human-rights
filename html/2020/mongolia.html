				<hr>
<p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong> The Department of State will release 
an addendum to this report in mid 2021 that expands the subsection on 
Women in Section 6 to include a broader range of issues related to 
reproductive rights.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mongolia is a multiparty parliamentary democracy governed by a 
democratically elected government. June 24 parliamentary elections were 
peaceful and generally considered free and fair, although several 
candidates during the election season were detained and prosecuted. In 
addition some observers expressed concern regarding allegations of vote 
buying.</p>
<p>The National Police Agency and the General Authority for Border 
Protection, which operate under the Ministry of Justice and Home 
Affairs, are primarily responsible for internal security. The General 
Intelligence Agency, whose director reports to the prime minister, 
assists these two agencies with internal security. The armed forces 
report to the Ministry of Defense and assist internal security forces in
 providing domestic emergency assistance and disaster relief. Civilian 
authorities maintained control over the security forces. Members of the 
security forces committed some abuses.</p>
<p>Significant human rights issues included: harsh prison conditions; 
threats against the independence of the judiciary; the existence of 
criminal libel laws; serious acts of official corruption; violence or 
threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or 
intersex persons; and forced child labor.</p>
<p>Government efforts to punish officials who committed human rights abuses were inconsistent.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports the government or its agents committed 
arbitrary or unlawful killings. Responsibility for investigating 
allegations of killings by security forces is assigned to either local 
police or the Independent Authority against Corruption (IAAC), with the 
IAAC generally responsible for crimes committed while on duty.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits such practices. Nevertheless, the National 
Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and other nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs) reported some prisoners and detainees were subjected to 
unnecessary force and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or 
punishment, particularly to obtain confessions.</p>
<p>Responsibility for investigating allegations of torture and abuse is 
assigned to either local police or the Independent Authority against 
Corruption (IAAC), with the IAAC generally responsible for crimes 
committed while on duty. The prosecutorâs office oversees such 
investigations.</p>
<p>In July the Tuv provincial court convicted the former head of the 
General Intelligence Agency, the former deputy prosecutor general, and 
seven other officials of the 2017 torture of suspects convicted of 
murder in connection with the 1998 assassination of Zorig Sanjaasuren, a
 leader of the countryâs democratic revolution. The defendants received 
prison sentences ranging from one to three years.</p>
<p>The NHRC, NGOs, and defense attorneys reported that in an attempt to 
coerce or intimidate detainees, authorities sometimes threatened 
detaineesâ families, transferred detainees repeatedly, or placed them in
 detention centers far from their homes and families, making access to 
legal counsel and visits by family members difficult. Human rights NGOs 
and attorneys reported obstacles to gathering evidence of torture or 
abuse. For example, although many prisons and detention facilities had 
cameras for monitoring prisoner interrogations, authorities often 
reported the equipment was inoperable at the time of reported abuses.</p>
<p>Under the criminal code, all public officials are subject to 
prosecution for abuse or torture, including both physical and 
psychological abuse. The maximum punishment for torture is a five-year 
prison sentence, or life in prison if the victim dies as a result of 
torture. Although officials are liable for intentional infliction of 
severe bodily injury, prosecutions of this crime were rare. The law 
states that prohibited acts do not constitute a crime when committed in 
accordance with an order given by a superior in the course of official 
duties and without knowledge the act was prohibited. A person who 
knowingly enforces an illegal order is considered an accomplice to the 
crime. The law provides that the person who gives an illegal order is 
criminally liable for the harm caused, but prosecutions were rare. 
According to the NHRC, prosecutors, and judges, the law effectively 
provides immunity to officials allegedly engaged in coercing confessions
 at the behest of investigators or prosecutors. The NHRC also indicated 
authorities sometimes abandoned complaints of alleged psychological 
torture either for lack of evidence or because the degree of injury 
could not be determined.</p>
<p>January 10 amendments to the criminal procedure law set out the legal
 requirements for victim compensation in torture cases and for the first
 time include emotional distress as a valid claim under the civil law. 
Courts, however, tended to compensate only for demonstrable physical 
injuries.</p>
<p>As of September 1, the NPA reported investigating eight complaints of
 rape by law enforcement officials, among them a police officer and a 
GEACD officer.</p>
<p>In January news emerged of a December 2019 case in which two police 
officers received three-year prison sentences after being convicted of 
the rape of minors. The sentences were inconsistent with applicable law,
 which mandates a sentence of eight to 15 years in prison if certain 
aggravating factors exist. Two of these factorsâcoercion and assault of 
underage victims and causing an underage victim to become pregnantâwere 
present in this case.</p>
<p>Impunity was not a significant problem in the security forces. The 
NHRC, lawyers, human rights activists, and NGOs continued to raise 
concerns regarding impunity for law enforcement officials and demanded 
the re-establishment of a special investigation unit under the 
Prosecutor Generalâs Office that had been dissolved in 2014. They noted 
that investigations of criminal acts committed by security forces and 
law enforcement personnel were frequently handled internally, with the 
most serious penalty being termination of employment rather than 
criminal conviction. On January 23, parliament passed a law establishing
 a commissioner in charge of torture prevention, with the authority to 
make unannounced inspections of places of detention and interrogation. 
The NHRC, however, reported it was unable to support meaningfully the 
new commissioner due to lack of funding.</p>
<p>In a September report, Amnesty International concluded that the 
government failed to ensure that all victims of torture and other abuse 
had access to effective remedies and redress.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h3>

					
					<p>Conditions in prisons (which hold convicted criminals), arrest 
centers (which hold petty offenders), and pretrial detention centers 
(for those awaiting trial) were sometimes harsh due to lack of 
investment in the prison system; inadequate health care, sanitation, and
 food; poor infrastructure; and lack of security and control.</p>
<p><u></u>Physical Conditions: Authorities assigned male prisoners a 
security level based on the severity of their crimes and held them in a 
prison of the corresponding security level. There was only one prison 
for women, with separate facilities for different security levels, as 
well as a facility for female prisoners with infant children. 
Authorities held pretrial detainees in separate facilities from 
convicted prisoners.</p>
<p>The 21 prisons and 29 pretrial detention centers were generally not 
overcrowded, although there were reports of overcrowding in two arrest 
centers. NGOs and government officials reported that in the five older 
pretrial detention centers in rural areas, insufficient medical care, 
clothing, bedding, food, potable water, heating, lighting, ventilation, 
sanitary facilities, and accommodations for persons with disabilities 
were often problems. Conditions in police-operated alcohol 
detoxification centers were poor.</p>
<p>The GEACD reported three deaths in prisons and one in pretrial 
detention facilities as of September 28. According to the GEACD, 13 
prisoners had contracted tuberculosis as of September 28. Correctional 
officials routinely released terminally ill patients shortly before 
death, which NGOs alleged led to misleadingly low prisoner death 
statistics.</p>
<p><u></u>Administration: The Prosecutor Generalâs Office monitors 
conditions in prisons, arrest centers, and detention centers; it and the
 NHRC conducted multiple scheduled, surprise, and complaint-based 
inspections of prisons, pretrial detention centers, arrest centers, and 
police-run detoxification centers.</p>
<p><u></u>Independent Monitoring: The government allowed access by 
independent nongovernmental observers and the NHRC, but authorities 
sometimes limited the areas observers could visit.</p>
<p><u></u>Improvements: The GEACD opened a new arrest center in February
 to address overcrowding issues. It also repurposed the former prison 
for juveniles into a rehabilitation facility for juvenile offenders.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides that no person shall be arrested, detained, or 
deprived of liberty except by specified procedures and provides for the 
right of any person to challenge the lawfulness of his or her arrest or 
detention in court. Government agencies generally observed these 
requirements. The General Intelligence Agency sometimes detained 
suspects for questioning without charge, but the criminal code requires 
that a prosecutor supervise all detentions.</p>
<p>Several current or former high-level government officials and 
influential businesspersons, including six candidates or would-be 
candidates and one sitting member of parliament, were detained, tried, 
or convicted in the weeks surrounding June 24 parliamentary elections, 
in most cases on abuse of power, corruption charges, or both. Some of 
these defendants claimed the timing of their detention and 
prosecutionâin some cases coming years after the completion of the 
corresponding IAAC investigationâindicated they were being politically 
targeted, as it prevented them from registering as candidates, mounting a
 campaign, and assuming their seat in parliament (if elected). They 
cited relevant provisions of the law granting immunity to incumbent 
parliamentarians and credentialed candidates. Some commentators noted 
that several of these defendants were known political rivals of senior 
government officials.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>An evidence-based, prosecutor-approved warrant is generally 
required to arrest a suspect on criminal grounds. Within 24 hours of an 
arrest, a prosecutor must present a request stating the grounds and 
reasons for the arrest to a judge, who must decide within 48 hours 
whether to prolong the detention or release the suspect. The arresting 
authority must notify a suspectâs family within six hours of an arrest. A
 âpressing circumstancesâ exception in the law allows police to arrest 
suspects without a warrant. Examples of exceptions include murder or 
grave bodily injury, serious property damage, hot pursuit of a fleeing 
suspect, and suspicion that destruction of evidence would occur. In such
 cases a prosecutor must approve the arrest within 24 hours, and a judge
 must approve the arrest within the normal 48-hour period. If 72 hours 
pass after an arrest and a judge has not made a decision, police must 
release the suspect. Upon release, authorities must inform the suspect 
of the reasons for the arrest and detention.</p>
<p>A January 10 amendment to the criminal procedure law introduced the 
possibility of bail, tying the amount to be charged to the severity of 
the crime and the personal situation of the defendant. Although 
procedures governing the collection of bail had yet to be adopted, bail 
was assessed in several cases, most notably in the prosecution of 
several high-profile defendants, including some candidates, in the 
lead-up to and during parliamentary elections. Attorneys for some of the
 defendants criticized the courtsâ imposition of what they viewed as 
arbitrary and in some cases exceedingly steep bail amounts in the 
absence of regulatory guidance on the setting of such fees.</p>
<p>Authorities generally charged and informed detainees of the charges 
promptly and advised them of their right to counsel. Maximum pretrial 
detention with a court order is 18 months. Detainees generally had 
prompt access to family members, although repeated transfers or 
detention in remote locations undermined this right.</p>
<p>A detainee has the right to an attorney during pretrial detention and
 all subsequent stages of the legal process, including after sentencing.
 If a defendant does not engage an attorney, the government must appoint
 one if the defendant has a physical or mental disability that would 
hinder self-defense, is a minor, is not proficient in the Mongolian 
language, or has a conflict of interest with the defense counsel or 
other defendants. The law allows the government to provide a lawyer upon
 request for an indigent defendant. Detainees were generally aware of 
their right to legal counsel, but misperceptions limited their use of 
this right. For example, detainees were frequently unaware they could 
exercise this right from the start of the legal process and frequently 
did not assert it unless and until their cases reached trial.</p>
<p><u></u>Arbitrary Arrest: The NHRC had received 70 complaints of 
illegal arrest, arbitrary detention, and extended imprisonment as of 
October 7, of which six complaints of illegal arrest and 14 complaints 
of arbitrary detention were referred for prosecution. It reported that 
when conducting investigations, investigative agencies occasionally 
detained suspects without judicial authorization, sometimes secretly, 
and police employed such practices despite the availability of other 
methods of restraint, including bail, another personâs personal 
guarantee, and military surveillance. The personal guarantee system 
allows relatives to vouch for an accused family member.</p>
<p><u></u>Detainee<u></u>â<u></u>s Ability to Challenge Lawfulness of 
Detention before a Court: At least two of the candidates and would-be 
candidates detained in the run-up to the parliamentary elections 
complained they had been denied the opportunity to appeal the lawfulness
 of their detention.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, 
but NGOs and private businesses reported that judicial corruption and 
third-party influence continued. Courts rarely entered not guilty 
verdicts or dismissed criminal charges over the objection of 
prosecutors, even when full trials had produced no substantial evidence 
of guilt. Courts often returned criminal cases to prosecutors when 
acquittal appeared more appropriate. Consequently, some serious criminal
 cases cycled for years between prosecutors and the courts without 
resolution.</p>
<p>There were serious concerns regarding the independence of the 
judiciary following March 2019 changes to laws on the judicial system. 
Those changes gave the National Security Council, which comprises the 
president, prime minister, and speaker of the parliament, the authority 
to recommend: the suspension of judges, subject to the approval of the 
Judicial General Council; the dismissal of the prosecutor and deputy 
prosecutor general; and the dismissal of IAAC officials, subject to 
approval of the parliament. Six of 17 judges suspended in 2019 under the
 changes were reinstated during the year; the others remained under 
investigation. Despite a Supreme Court ruling that two of the suspended 
judges were not guilty, the two had not been reinstated as of December.</p>
<p>The Judicial General Council and court administrators stated 
courtrooms were inadequate and outdated and that insufficient funding 
affected court operations. Nearly 200 judgeships were vacant due to lack
 of funding.</p>
<p>The law requires all trials to be open to the public and the press, 
with the exception of cases involving state secrets, underage 
defendants, or underage victims. In several cases, however, courts 
rejected defendantsâ requests to open their trials to the public and 
media, citing lack of space, COVID-19-related social distancing 
requirements, or both. In such cases the courts generally allowed 
selected representatives of the press to attend the opening and closing 
sessions of the trial.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Trial Procedures</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the right to a fair and public trial without undue delay, and the judiciary generally enforced this right.</p>
<p>Defendants are presumed innocent and have the right to be informed of
 the charges against them and to a fair, timely, and public trial. 
Courts provide free interpretation services as needed, including sign 
language interpretation, unless a court decides to recover procedural 
expenses from a defendant found guilty. The law also extends to all 
defendants the right to be present at their own trial in the court of 
first instance (but not during appeals); to communicate with an attorney
 of their choice (or one provided at public expense); to receive 
adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense; to confront 
witnesses; to present oneâs own witnesses and evidence; not to be 
compelled to testify or confess guilt; and to appeal. NGOs and observers
 reported that authorities sometimes did not observe these rights and 
that nepotism, bribery of judges, prosecutors, and expert witnesses, of 
both sometimes contributed to unwarranted convictions, dismissals, or 
reductions of sentences.</p>
<p>Procedural due process errors and inconsistencies often affected 
trials. Although the number of government-provided defense lawyers was 
adequate given the limited circumstances in which they are provided, 
their quality and experience were inconsistent, and many defendants 
lacked adequate legal representation. Judges often relied on confessions
 with little corroborating evidence. Furthermore, NGOs reported witness 
intimidation by government authorities and police, a lack of 
transparency in courtsâ decision-making processes, and a low level of 
awareness regarding new criminal and procedural laws.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for freedom of expression, including for the 
press, and the government generally respected this right. The government
 imposed content restrictions in some instances, licensing occasionally 
proved problematic, and there was reported harassment of journalists.</p>
<p><u></u>Freedom of <u></u>Press and Media<u></u>, Including Online 
Media: A law passed in April on measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic
 includes fines for individuals or legal entities found guilty of 
spreading disinformation about the pandemic. Globe International Center,
 a local NGO specializing in freedom of the press and media, noted that 
the law authorizes police to determine initially whether editorial 
content contained misleading or false information.</p>
<p>Globe International Center reported continued pressure from police, 
politicians, and large business entities on local media and press 
outlets. The ownership and political affiliations of media often were 
not disclosed to the public, and in a 2018-19 survey by Globe 
International, seven of 10 journalists reported that at least once in 
their career state officials did not respond to their requests for 
information that by law should have been publicly available.</p>
<p>The NGO Mongolian Center for Investigative Journalism observed there 
are no legal protections for whistleblowers and confidential sources. In
 a 2019 Globe International Center survey of 300 journalists, 51 percent
 said they had been forced to reveal confidential sources at least once 
in their career.</p>
<p>The law allows media organizations to seek redress against a person 
who, by threats of violence, attempted bribery, or other means of 
intimidation, seeks to compel them to withhold critical information 
about that person. In such cases the media organization may pursue 
criminal charges or file a civil complaint against the alleged offender.
 If convicted, that person is subject to a fine, revocation of the right
 to travel from one to six months, and one to six monthsâ imprisonment.</p>
<p><u></u>Violence and Harassment: Some journalists reported they faced 
violence, harassment, or intimidation by police. According to the 2019 
Globe International Center survey, 67 percent of journalists said they 
had experienced some form of threat or intimidation in connection with 
their reporting at least once in their career.</p>
<p>One journalist who reported for the popular <i>zarig.mn</i> online 
news portal reported receiving an official notice from the NPAâs 
investigation department in September asking the journalist to disclose 
sources in connection with an article about misconduct by General 
Intelligence Agency officials. The journalist said they had been the 
target of police questioning 12 times in a two-year period. In another 
case highlighted by Globe International, police in Khuvsgul Province 
pressured a journalist to reveal her sources in connection with an 
investigative report she produced for television in March.</p>
<p><u></u>Censorship or Content Restrictions: Communications Regulatory 
Commission regulations on digital content and television and radio 
service impose content restrictions in broad terms, for example on 
extreme violence. The government appoints the chair and members of the 
commission, which grants television and radio broadcast licenses without
 public consultation. This process, together with a lack of transparency
 during the license-tendering process, inhibited fair access to 
broadcast frequencies and benefited those with political connections. 
This also contributed to some self-censorship by journalists.</p>
<p>In January the criminal code was amended to include the spreading of 
âevidently false information thereby causing damage to othersâ honor, 
dignity, or the business reputation of legal entitiesâ (an offense 
distinct from libel or slander) from a petty offense to a crime 
punishable by a fine, 240 to 720 hours of community service, revocation 
of the right to travel for one to three months, or some combination of 
these.</p>
<p>Globe International Center expressed concern regarding efforts by 
some government authorities to make all libel and slander cases criminal
 offenses. Several journalists based outside Ulaanbaatar reported 
frequently receiving threats of legal action from politicians seeking to
 stifle their reporting.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Internet Freedom</h3>

					
					<p>By law individuals and groups may engage in the peaceful 
expression of views on the internet. The government maintained a list of
 blocked websites and added sites to the list for alleged violations of 
relevant laws and regulations, including those relating to intellectual 
property. Information on the number of newly blocked websites was not 
available.</p>
<p>A regulation places broad restrictions on inappropriate content 
without defining objectionable content explicitly. The regulation 
requires websites with heavy traffic to use filtering software that 
makes publicly visible the internet protocol addresses of those 
commenting or sharing content.</p>
<p>In September the NPA established a special unit tasked with combating
 disinformation deemed damaging to national security and preventing the 
public from being exposed to misleading information. The unit is 
empowered to investigate and delete from social media any information 
âof a criminal nature,â including defamation, slander, disinformation, 
content that seduces others into promiscuity, and content that organizes
 gambling activities. Members of the public and civil society criticized
 this as an attempt by the government to suppress free speech.</p>
<p>In February a citizen in Khuvsgul Province was found guilty of 
criminal dissemination of false information and fined 550,000 tugriks 
($193). He criticized local police on his Facebook account, accusing 
them of misuse of power during the state of heightened emergency related
 to the pandemic.</p>

receive timely notification. Authorities did not allow persons under 
exit bans to leave until the disputes leading to the bans were resolved

<p><u></u>Access to Basic Services: Because the law does not provide for
 refugee status, asylum seekers generally did not have access to

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-3__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Elections and Political Participation</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Recent Elections: Parliamentary elections were held June 
24. Due to COVID-19-related border restrictions and quarantine 
requirements, international observer missions were unable to conduct 
election monitoring. Nevertheless, the overall consensus among NGOs, 
press, and other observers was that the elections were generally 
conducted in an orderly and efficient manner while also complying with 
social distancing requirements. Some opposition parties, coalitions, and
 independent candidates complained that the three-week campaign period 
put them at a disadvantage, as it provided inadequate time for them to 
establish name and platform recognition in their constituencies.</p>
<p>Citizens residing abroad were excluded from voting in the June 
elections, as were more than two thousand citizens confined to 
government-facilitated quarantine or home isolation after returning from
 abroad, as well as the medical, service, and security personnel 
attending them. The General Election Commission acknowledged it had 
inadequate infrastructure to facilitate voting by quarantined or 
isolated citizens while also protecting election workers.</p>
<p><u></u>Participation of Women and <u></u>Members of Minority Groups: 
No laws limit participation of women or members of minority groups in 
the political process, and they did participate. According to election 
law, at least 20 percent of candidates nominated by a political party or
 coalition for local and national political office must be women; 
political parties generally complied with this requirement. For example,
 in the June parliamentary election, approximately 25 percent of the 
candidates nominated by the various political parties and coalitions 
were women. Women voters outnumbered men at the polls by 11 percentage 
points.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-4" class="report__section-title">Section 4. Corruption and Lack of Transparency in Government</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>Corruption at all levels of government remained widespread. The 
politicization of anticorruption efforts presented an obstacle to 
effectively addressing corruption. The law provides criminal penalties 
for corruption by officials, but the government did not always implement
 the law effectively, and corruption continued at all levels. Some 
officials engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. The government 
implemented the fourth year of a six-year action plan to combat 
corruption, adopted in 2016. The criminal code contains liability 
provisions for corruption and corruption-related offenses for public 
servants and government officials. For example, the code dictates that 
those sentenced for corruption may not work in public service.</p>
<p><u></u>Corruption: During the year five former members of parliament,
 including a former cabinet minister and two former prime ministers, 
were convicted of abuse of power and official position in connection 
with various corruption cases investigated by the IAAC. They received 
sentences ranging from two to 10 yearsâ imprisonment and a ban on 
holding public office.</p>
<p><u></u>Financial Disclosure: The law requires civil servants and 
elected officials to report assets and outside sources of income for 
themselves, their spouses, parents, children, and live-in siblings. It 
also aims to prevent conflicts of interest between official duties and 
the private interests of those in public service roles, and to regulate 
and monitor conflicts of interest to specify that officials act in the 
public interest. The law requires candidates for public office to submit
 financial statements and questionnaires on personal business interests.</p>
<p>Public officials must file a private interest declaration with the 
IAAC within 30 days of appointment or election and annually thereafter 
during their terms of public service. The law provides that such 
declarations be accessible to the public and prescribes a range of 
administrative sanctions and disciplinary actions in case of violation. 
Violators may receive formal warnings, face salary reductions or fines, 
or be dismissed from their positions. The IAAC is required to review the
 asset declarations of public servants, including police officers and 
members of the military. As of September the IAAC made publicly 
available the financial disclosure short forms for 35,832 incumbent 
public officials.</p>
<p>Officials with authority to spend government funds are required to 
report expenditures and audit results on their ministry and agency 
websites. All transactions of more than one million tugriks ($350) are 
subject to reporting. Plans for budgets, loans, or bonds must be 
registered with the Ministry of Finance for monitoring and tracking, 
even after the originating officials have left their positions.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A variety of domestic and international human rights groups 
generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
were sometimes cooperative and responsive to their views.</p>
<p>Amnesty International has received reports of discrimination, 
intimidation, harassment, police intimidation, and stigmatization 
against human rights organizations. Progovernment actors sometimes 
characterized such NGOs as âundesirables,â âtroublemakers,â âforeign 
agents,â or âopponents of the state.â</p>
<p><u></u>Government Human Rights Bodies: The NHRC is responsible for 
monitoring human rights abuses, initiating and reviewing policy changes,
 and coordinating with human rights NGOs. NHRCâs five commissioners are 
selected on a competitive basis and appointed by parliament for six-year
 terms. Officials reported government funding for the NHRC, provided by 
parliament, remained inadequate, and inspection, training, and public 
awareness activities were entirely dependent on external funding 
sources. The NHRC consistently supported politically contentious human 
rights issues, such as the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, or intersex (LGBTI) individuals, persons with disabilities,
 and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>There was some collaboration between the government and civil society in discussing human rights problems.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">Women</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Rape and Domestic Violence: The criminal code 
criminalizes forced or nonconsensual sexual intercourse or sexual acts 
that involve the use or threat of physical violence, abuse a position of
 authority (financial or official), or take advantage of the victimâs 
incapacity to protect him- or herself or object to the commission of the
 act due to mental illness, temporary loss of mental capacity, or the 
influence of drugs or alcohol, and provides for sentences of one to 20 
yearsâ imprisonment or life imprisonment, depending on the 
circumstances. The criminal code criminalizes spousal rape. Domestic 
violence is also a crime, for which perpetrators can be punished 
administratively or criminally, including in the latter case by a 
maximum of two yearsâ imprisonment. The government maintains a 
nationwide database of domestic violence offenders, and those who commit
 a second domestic violence offense are automatically charged under 
criminal law.</p>
<p>The nongovernmental National Center against Violence (NCAV) reported 
that police response to domestic violence complaints improved. Although 
the law provides alternative protection measures for victims of domestic
 abuse, such as restraining orders, it has not yet been implemented due 
to a lack of training, technical, and other resources.</p>
<p>Despite continued attention, domestic violence remained a serious and
 widespread problem. The NCAV reported increased reporting of domestic 
violence by third parties. Combating domestic violence is included in 
the accredited training curriculum of the police academy and in all 
police officer position descriptions.</p>
<p>According to the NPA, there were 31,043 domestic violence complaints 
registered as of October 1. NCAV reported a 1.4 percent increase in 
reported serious domestic violence crimes and a 36.8 percent increase in
 petty domestic violence offenses during the first eight months of the 
year. They attributed this rise to school closures and restrictions on 
movements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. NCAV reported a 20 
percent increase in demand for shelter services and a 36.8 increase in 
calls received by its hotline, compared with the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>The Family, Child, and Youth Development Authority reported a 99 
percent increase in domestic violence cases classified as petty offenses
 during the period of COVID-19-related restrictions on movements.</p>
<p>The NCAV expanded its activities to support domestic violence victims
 with disabilities by engaging sign language interpreters and renovating
 facilities to make them more accessible to persons who use wheelchairs 
or have other mobility difficulties.</p>
<p>In January the NPA established a special unit dedicated to combating 
domestic violence. According to the NPA, there were 18 shelters and 16 
one-stop service centers for domestic violence survivors run by the NPA,
 a variety of NGOs, local government agencies, and hospitals. All 
shelters followed standard operating procedures developed by the NCAV. 
The one-stop service centers, located primarily at hospitals, provided 
emergency shelter for a maximum of 72 hours. The relatively small number
 of shelters located in rural areas presented a problem for domestic 
violence victims in those areas.</p>
<p>A May assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on gender-based violence 
conducted by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection and the UN 
Population Fund revealed that social and economic stresses caused by the
 pandemic were major causes of domestic violence and violence against 
children.</p>
<p><u></u>Sexual Harassment: The criminal code does not address sexual 
harassment. NGOs said there was a lack of awareness and consensus within
 society of what constituted inappropriate behavior, making it difficult
 to gauge the extent of the problem. As of September 1, the NHRC had 
received one sexual harassment complaint that was referred for the 
prosecution and resulted in a dismissal. Upon receiving such a 
complaint, the NHRC may perform an investigation, after which it may 
send a letter to the employer recommending administrative sanctions be 
levied against the accused party.</p>
<p><u></u>Coercion in Population Control: There were no reports of 
coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization on the part of government 
authorities.</p>
<p><u></u>Discrimination: The law provides the same legal status and 
rights to women and men, including equal pay for equal work and equal 
access to education. These rights were generally observed, although 
women faced discrimination in employment. As of October 7, the NHRC had 
received nine complaints of discrimination: five based on social status,
 three on disability, and one on sexual orientation.</p>
<p>The law sets mandatory minimum quotas for women in the government and
 political parties. It also prohibits discrimination based on sex, 
appearance, or age, although some NGOs noted authorities did not enforce
 this provision. By law women must comprise at least 15 percent of 
political appointees to government positions at the national, 
provincial, and capital city levels; 20 percent at the district level; 
and 30 percent at subdistrict levels. The law also requires that women 
must represent at least 25 percent of a political partyâs senior 
leadership. Women were underrepresented at the highest levels of 
government, although representation improved marginally following June 
parliamentary elections. Of the countryâs 16 cabinet ministers, three 
were women; the prior cabinet had only one female minister. Of the 75 
members of the newly elected parliament, 13 were women; the previous 
parliament had 11 female members. One of two deputy speakers was a 
woman, as was the secretary general of the parliament secretariat. Only 
one of 11 parliamentary standing committee chairs was a woman, however. 
While the gender quota was met in most jurisdictions following the 
October local elections, Bayan-Ulgii Province failed to meet the quota 
at the provincial and some subprovincial levels.</p>
<p>In most cases the divorced wife retained custody of any children, but
 divorced husbands were often not penalized for failing to pay child 
support. Womenâs rights activists said that because family businesses 
and properties usually were registered under the husbandâs name, 
ownership continued to be transferred automatically to the former 
husband in divorce cases.</p>
<p>The National Committee on Gender Equality, chaired by the prime 
minister and overseen by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, 
coordinates policy and womenâs interests among ministries, NGOs, and 
gender councils at the provincial and local levels. The governmentâs <i>National Program on Gender Equality 2017-21</i> and its related action plan seek the economic empowerment of women and equal participation in political and public life.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Children</h3>

					
					<p><u></u>Birth Registration: Citizenship derives from oneâs 
parents. Births are immediately registered and a registration number 
issued through an online system jointly developed by the Ministry of 
Health, National Statistics Office, and State Registration Agency. 
Failure to register could result in the denial of public services.</p>
<p><u></u>Child Abuse: The criminal code includes a specific chapter on 
crimes against children, including abandonment, inducing addiction, 
engaging children in criminal activity or hazardous labor, forced 
begging, or engaging in pornography.</p>
<p>Child abuse was a significant problem and consisted principally of 
domestic violence and sexual abuse. The Family, Child, and Youth 
Development Authority (FCYDA) operated a hotline to report child abuse, 
an emergency service center, and a shelter for child victims of abuse. 
The government-run shelter served child victims of domestic violence, 
sexual abuse, neglect, and abandonment, but it had inadequate capacity 
to provide separate accommodation for especially vulnerable or sensitive
 children. The FCYDA also stated it provided funding to an NGO in 
Ulaanbaatar to run additional shelters to which it referred child 
victims of abuse. According to an NGO, space was inadequate for the 
number of child abuse victims referred for long-term care.</p>
<p>Although the FCYDA reported an increase in reports of child abuse in 
previous years following enactment of obligatory reporting laws, reports
 of child abuse fell by 30 percent during the year compared with 2019, 
largely attributed to the fact that the primary reporters of such 
abusesâschools, kindergartens, and other educational institutionsâwere 
closed between January and September due to COVID-19-related protective 
measures.</p>
<p>Child abandonment was also a problem. Some children were orphaned or 
ran away from home because of neglect or parental abuse. Police 
officials stated they sent children of abusive parents to shelters, but 
some observers indicated many youths were returned to abusive parents. 
According to the FCYDA, as of August there were 1,069 children living in
 31 child-care centers across the country. More children were referred 
to long-term care than there was space available. As of September 25, 
1,248 child victims were assisted by 17 temporary shelters and 13 
one-stop service centers.</p>
<p>Each province and all of Ulaanbaatarâs district police offices had a 
specialized police officer appointed to investigate crimes against, or 
committed by, juveniles. The international NGO Save the Children 
implemented a program to facilitate annualâand sometimes more 
frequentâinteragency meetings on preventing child abuse at local 
administrative units across the country. Police were active in campaigns
 to improve the safety of children and increase childrenâs awareness of 
their rights, and they broadcast a variety of public-service 
announcements through programs and commercials broadcast on television, 
radio, and social media.</p>
<p><u></u>Child, <u></u>Early<u></u>,<u></u> and Forced Marriage: The 
legal minimum age for marriage is 18, with court-approved exceptions for
 minors age 16 to 18 who obtain the consent of parents or guardians.</p>
<p><u></u>Sexual Exploitation of Children: Although illegal, the 
commercial sexual exploitation of children younger than 18 was a 
problem. The minimum age for consensual sex is 16. Violators of the 
statutory rape law (defined as sexual intercourse with a person younger 
than 16 not involving physical violence or the threat of violence) are 
subject to a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Those who engaged 
children in prostitution or sexual exploitation are subject to a maximum
 penalty of 20 years in prison, or life imprisonment if aggravating 
circumstances are present. Under the criminal code, the maximum penalty 
for engaging children in pornography is eight yearsâ imprisonment. 
According to the NPA, 58 percent of child victims of sexual abuse were 
abused by family members or close associates, and 63 percent of the 
registered rape cases involved child victims of sexual abuse.</p>
<p><u></u>International Child Abductions: The country is not a party to 
the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs <i>Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction</i> at <a class="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210331124104/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data/reported-cases.html" target="_self"> <span class="external-link-title">https://

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Persons with Disabilities</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination against persons with 
disabilities, defining these as persons with long-term physical, 
intellectual, mental, or sensory impairments which, in interaction with 
various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in 
society on an equal basis with others. A representative of the 
disability community said the concept of workplace accommodation was not
 well understood and access to employment was therefore poor for persons
 with disabilities. She attributed this to a lack of expertise and 
awareness in government and business.</p>
<p>Most government buildings remained inaccessible to wheelchairs, and 
only a few intersections in Ulaanbaatar were equipped with auditory 
crosswalks to aid pedestrians with visual impairments.</p>
<p>There is no explicit prohibition of discrimination in education, but 
the law charges the government with creating conditions to provide 
students with disabilities an education. Children with disabilities are 
by law allowed to attend preschools and mainstream schools but faced 
significant barriers. Schools often lacked trained staff and the 
infrastructure to accommodate children with disabilities.</p>
<p>Autism and Mongolia, an NGO serving children with intellectual 
disabilities, reported that a 2019 order requiring mainstream schools to
 facilitate inclusive education and retrofit schools accordingly had yet
 to be implemented due to inadequate teacher training and lack of a 
system for employing assistant teachers. COVID-19 and Disability, a 
survey conducted jointly by the Open Society Forum and the Association 
of Parents with Differently-abled Children, stated the transition from 
classroom teaching to distance and virtual learning in response to the 
pandemic had impaired the learning process for children with 
disabilities, and parents noted that classes offered through television 
broadcasts did not meet special needs. Although the majority of children
 with disabilities entered the public-school system at the appropriate 
age, the dropout rate increased as the children aged. Children with 
disabilities in rural areas were more likely to drop out of school 
because most schools for students with disabilities were in Ulaanbaatar.</p>
<p>Although the law mandates standards for physical access to new public
 buildings and a representative of persons with disabilities serves on 
the state commission for inspecting standards of new buildings, most new
 buildings were not constructed in compliance with the law. Public 
transport remained largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. 
Emergency services were often inaccessible to blind and deaf persons 
because service providers lacked trained personnel and appropriate 
technologies. A representative of the disability community said 
information was not always accessible, especially on government and 
business websites, such as for online banking applications. Most 
domestic violence shelters were not accessible to persons with 
disabilities.</p>
<p>To mitigate economic harm caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
government disbursed an additional 100,000 tugriks ($35) per month to 
social welfare recipients, including children with disabilities.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Acts of Violence, Criminalization, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h3>

					
					<p>Instances of covert police surveillance of LGBTI persons and 
social events, arbitrary detentions, intimidation, threats, and physical
 and sexual assaults by police were reported. In addition LGBTI 
prisoners also reportedly suffered physical and sexual abuse from other 
inmates.</p>
<p>An NGO noted that despite increased police awareness of abuses faced 
by the LGBTI community and capacity to respond to problems affecting 
LGBTI persons, there were reported cases involving police harassment of 
LGBTI victims of alleged crimes. Authorities frequently dismissed 
charges when a crime victim was an LGBTI person.</p>
<p>LGBTI individuals faced violence and discrimination both in public 
and at home based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. There 
were reports LGBTI persons faced greater discrimination and fear in 
rural areas than in Ulaanbaatar due to less public awareness and limited
 online media accessibility in rural areas. The NGO LGBT Center received
 reports of violence against LGBTI persons, most involving young persons
 disclosing their LGBTI status to their families or whose families 
discovered they were LGBTI.</p>
<p>Evidence gathered from the LGBTI community suggested a lack of 
understanding of sexual minorities among health-care providers, as well 
as a lack of understanding of the attendant physical and psychological 
problems members of the LGBTI community might face. LGBTI persons said 
they feared that the disclosure of their sexuality to health-service 
providers would lead to ridicule, denial of service, or reporting of 
their sexuality to other government authorities. Evidence indicated a 
higher suicide rate among the LGBTI community, particularly among youth,
 than among the general population.</p>
<p>There were reports of discrimination against LGBTI persons in employment.</p>

					<p>Although there was no official discrimination against those with
 HIV or AIDS, some societal discrimination existed. The public generally
 continued to associate HIV and AIDS with same-sex sexual activity, 
burdening victims with social stigma and potential employment 
discrimination.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the right of workers to form or join 
independent unions and professional organizations of their choosing 
without previous authorization or excessive requirements. The law 
provides for the rights of all workers except those employed in 
essential services to participate in union activities without 
discrimination, conduct strikes, and bargain collectively. The law 
requires reinstatement of workers fired for union activity.</p>
<p>The law bars persons employed in essential servicesâdefined as 
occupations critical for national defense and safety, including police, 
utilities, and transportation servicesâfrom striking, and it prohibits 
third parties from organizing strikes. The law prohibits strikes 
unrelated to matters regulated by a collective agreement.</p>
<p>The government generally enforced laws providing for the rights of 
collective bargaining and freedom of association. Penalties, largely 
fines, were not commensurate with those for similar violations. Labor 
dispute settlement committees resolved most disputes between individual 
workers and management. These committees comprise representatives of the
 local government, the employer, and the employee, who is joined by a 
representative of the Confederation of Mongolian Trade Unions (CMTU). 
The CMTU reported the court process was so lengthy many workers 
abandoned their cases due to time and expense.</p>
<p>The CMTU stated some employees faced obstacles, including the threat 
of salary deductions, to forming, joining, or participating in unions. 
Some employers prohibited workers from participating in union activities
 during work hours. The CMTU also stated workers terminated for union 
activity were not always reinstated. The CMTU reported some employers 
refused to conclude collective bargaining agreements.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory 
labor, except as part of a legally imposed sentence. The criminal code 
provides for a fine or imprisonment for forced labor offenses; these 
were not commensurate with penalties for similar serious crimes. The 
government did not effectively enforce the law. Inspection was not 
adequate, and inspectors did not perform unannounced inspections nor 
enforce the law in the informal sector.</p>
<p>There were isolated reports of forced labor, including forced child labor such as forced prostitution and begging.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits the worst forms of child labor. The law 
provides for penalties for forced labor or slavery; prohibits the use of
 children in prostitution; or the use, procurement, or offering of a 
child for the production and trafficking of drugs. The law prohibits 
children younger than 14 from working. The minimum age for work does not
 apply to children in the informal sector or to those who are 
self-employed. At age 14, children may, with parental and government 
permission, work a maximum of 30 hours per week to acquire vocational 
training and work experience. At age 15, children may enter into a 
vocational training contract with permission from parents or guardians. 
According to a Ministry of Labor and Social Protection order, children 
younger than 18 may not work in hazardous occupations such as mining and
 construction; engage in arduous work; serve as jockeys during the 
winter (children may be jockeys beginning at age seven during other 
seasons); participate in cultural, circus, or folk art performances at 
night; work in businesses that sell alcoholic beverages; or engage in 
roadside vending. Despite these restrictions, children were commonly 
seen participating in horse racing, roadside vending, and other 
occupations in contravention of the order.</p>
<p>The government did not effectively enforce the law. Authorities 
reported employers often required minors to work in excess of 40 hours 
per week and paid them less than the minimum wage. Penalties were not 
criminal and were not commensurate with those for similar serious 
crimes. Child labor, including forced child labor, occurred in many 
sectors, including in hotels and restaurants, vehicle repair, 
manufacturing, petty trade, scavenging, forced begging, event or street 
contortionism (a local art form), and the illicit sex trade (see section
 6, Children). The FCYDA and the General Agency for Specialized 
Inspection (GASI) conducted announced child labor inspections, including
 at artisanal mining sites, public markets, service centers, dumpsites, 
construction and transportation sites, and on farms. The law did not 
apply to the informal sector, where most children worked.</p>
<p>International organizations continued to express concern regarding 
child jockeys in horseracing. Children commonly learned to ride horses 
at age four or five, and young children traditionally served as jockeys 
during the annual Naadam festival in races ranging from two to 20 miles.
 All jockeys including child jockeys are prohibited from working from 
November 1 to May 1, when cold weather makes racing more hazardous.</p>
<p>Racing regulations also require registration, insurance, adequate 
headgear, and chest protection, but despite greater government and 
public attention to safety, enforcement was inconsistent. The FCYDA 
registered 9,785 child jockeys who competed nationwide during the Naadam
 festival in July. In these races, 197 children reportedly suffered 
falls, but no serious injuries or deaths were reported. Unsanctioned 
racesâof which there were manyâwere not counted in these statistics.</p>
<p>The FCYDA maintained an electronic database containing information on
 more than 10,000 child jockeys and collected biometric information to 
better track jockeys and prevent children younger than seven from 
working as jockeys. In addition labor ministry guidelines require an 
insurance policy for jockeys that pays jockeys or their surviving family
 members up to 20 million tugriks ($7,000) in case of injury or death 
sustained during a race. Observers reported compliance with safety 
regulations at national races but less satisfactory compliance at 
community and regional events. The government, however, conducts child 
labor inspections at horse racing events only once a year and must 
provide 48 hoursâ notice before initiating an investigation.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination in employment and occupation 
based on nationality, language, race, age, gender, sexual orientation, 
sex or marital status, social origin or status, wealth, religion, 
ideology, education, or medical status. It also prohibits employers from
 refusing to employ a person with disabilities but provides broad 
exceptions, applying âunless the condition of such person prevents him 
from performing a specified activity or would otherwise be contrary to 
established working conditions at the workplace.â The law prohibits 
employers from refusing employment to or dismissing an individual 
diagnosed with HIV or AIDS unless the condition makes it difficult to 
perform job duties. The law also prohibits women from working in 
occupations that require heavy labor or exposure to chemicals that could
 affect infant and maternal health.</p>
<p>The government enforced the law inconsistently, and discrimination 
occurred in employment and occupation based on sex and disability, as 
well as on sexual orientation, gender identity, and HIV status. 
Penalties were not commensurate with those for similar violations.</p>
<p>The law charges employers with taking steps to prevent sexual 
harassment in the workplace, including by establishing internal rules 
about sexual harassment and the redress of complaints, but provides no 
penalties. The NHRC reported poor knowledge of the lawâs sexual 
harassment provisions among both employers and employees. The CMTU 
organized a campaign in July and August to raise awareness of sexual 
harassment, put an end to workplace coercion and harassment, and urge 
the implementation of recommendations on sexual harassment.</p>
<p>The NHRC found employers were less likely to hire, promote, or 
provide professional development opportunities to women. According to a 
survey conducted by the National Statistical Office in September, the 
monthly wages paid to men were, on average, 20 percent higher than those
 paid to women.</p>
<p>Although the law requires workplaces with more than 25 employees to 
employ a minimum of 4 percent of persons with disabilities or pay a 
fine, NGOs reported a reluctance to hire them persisted. They also noted
 the government itself failed to meet the quota. Members of the 
disability community noted that, even when hired, the lack of accessible
 public transport made it difficult for persons with disabilities to 
hold a job (see section 6, Persons with Disabilities).</p>
<p>The Labor Ministryâs Department for the Development of Persons with 
Disabilities is responsible for developing and implementing employment 
policies and projects for persons with disabilities. Government 
organizations and NGOs reported employersâ attitude toward employing 
persons with disabilities had not improved and that many employers still
 preferred to pay fines to the Employment Support Fund maintained by the
 Labor Ministry rather than employ persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>NGOs, the NHRC, and members of the LGBTI community reported companies
 rarely hired LGBTI persons who were open about their sexual orientation
 or gender identity, and LGBTI persons who revealed their status in the 
workplace frequently faced discrimination, including the possibility of 
dismissal. Illegally dismissed LGBTI persons rarely sought court 
injunctions to avoid disclosing their status and increasing the risk of 
discrimination.</p>
<p>Foreign migrant workers did not receive the same level of protection against labor law violations as the general population.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>The National Tripartite Committee, which comprises the 
government, the CMTU, and the Federation of Employers, annually 
establishes a national minimum wage that is above the poverty line. The 
law provides for a standard workweek of 40 hours and the payment of 
overtime, but in practice payment of overtime is rarely enforced. The 
law does not cover workers in the informal sector.</p>
<p>Laws on labor, cooperatives, and enterprises set occupational health 
and safety standards, which apply equally to local and foreign workers. 
GASI noted many standards were outdated.</p>
<p>Labor inspectors assigned to GASIâs regional and local offices are 
responsible for enforcement of all labor regulations and have the 
authority to compel immediate compliance. The government did not 
effectively enforce minimum wage, working hours, and occupational safety
 and health laws and regulations. GASI reported its inspectors, faced 
with large investigative workloads, needed better training on 
investigative techniques and evidence collection. The number of labor 
inspectors was insufficient for the size of the countryâs workforce. 
Inspectors generally did not conduct inspections in the informal sector.</p>
<p>GASI acknowledged that fines imposed on companies for not complying 
with labor standards or for concealing accidents were not commensurate 
with those for similar violations and did not compel management 
compliance. Moreover, safety experts responsible for labor safety and 
health were often inexperienced or had not received training. GASI lacks
 the authority to perform unannounced inspections.</p>
<p>The law on pensions allows for participation by small family 
businesses and workers in the informal economy (such as herders) in 
pension and social benefit programs. These categories of workers were 
able to access health care, education, social entitlements, and an 
optional form of social security.</p>
<p>Many workers received less than the minimum wage, particularly at 
smaller companies in rural areas. Workers in the construction sector, in
 which work is constrained to a few months each year due to extreme 
winters, were sometimes pressured to work long hours, increasing the 
risk of accidents and injuries.</p>
<p>Reliance on outmoded machinery, poor maintenance, and management 
errors led to frequent industrial accidents, particularly in the 
construction, mining, and energy sectors. According to the NHRC, lack of
 proper labor protection and safety procedures contributed to the high 
accident rate in the construction sector. Workers have the right to 
remove themselves from hazardous situations, but the CMTU stated workers
 had limited awareness of their legal right to refuse to work in unsafe 
conditions.</p>
<p>GASI provided safety training to companies and private enterprises. 
According to GASI, the training resulted in a decrease in industrial 
accidents in accident-prone sectors. Information on the number of deaths
 and injuries in industrial accidents was not available. In September 
demonstrations erupted in Umnugobi Province among truck drivers and 
their supporters after the deaths of three truck drivers hauling coal 
between a major coal mine and the Chinese border. Protesters cited 
dangerous road conditions, excessive work hours, employer retention of 
driversâ passports, and a lack of basic support and services for 
drivers.</p>
