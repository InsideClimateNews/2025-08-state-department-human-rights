				<h2 id="report-toc__exec-summary" class="report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

				<p>Mongolia is a multiparty parliamentary democracy governed by a 
democratically elected government. The 2017 presidential election and 
2016 parliamentary elections were considered free and fair, although 
some observers expressed concern during the presidential election about 
allegations of vote-buying and candidatesâ involvement in corruption.</p>
<p>The National Police Agency and the General Authority for Border 
Protection, which operate under the Ministry of Justice and Home 
Affairs, are primarily responsible for internal security. The General 
Intelligence Agency, whose director reports to the prime minister, 
assists these two agencies with internal security. The armed forces 
report to the Ministry of Defense and assist internal security forces in
 providing domestic emergency assistance and disaster relief. Civilian 
authorities maintained control over the security forces.</p>
<p>Significant human rights issues included: threats against the 
independence of the judiciary; harsh prison conditions; the existence of
 criminal libel laws; acts of official corruption; violence or threats 
of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or intersex 
persons; and forced child labor.</p>
<p>Government efforts to punish officials who committed human rights abuses were inconsistent.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits such practices. Nevertheless, the National 
Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and other nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs) reported some prisoners and detainees were subjected to 
unnecessary force and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or 
punishment, particularly to obtain confessions.</p>
<p>Responsibility for investigating allegations of torture and abuse is 
tasked by the prosecutorâs office to either local police or the 
Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC), with the IAAC generally
 responsible for higher-profile cases. According to the NHRC, as of 
September 1, there were 21 complaints of torture, including 14 
complaints against police officers, two against IAAC officers, and two 
against prison officials. As of September 1, the IAAC had opened 37 
torture investigations: 23 it referred back to the prosecutorâs office 
due to insufficient evidence, 12 remained under active investigation, 
one was sent to court for prosecution, and one was transferred to the 
relevant government body due to lack of IAAC jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The NHRC, NGOs, and defense attorneys reported that, in an attempt to
 coerce or intimidate detainees, authorities sometimes threatened 
detaineesâ families, transferred detainees repeatedly, or placed them in
 detention centers far from their homes and families, making access to 
legal counsel and visits by family members difficult. Human rights NGOs 
and attorneys reported obstacles to gathering evidence of torture or 
abuse. For example, although many prisons and detention facilities had 
cameras for monitoring prisoner interrogations, authorities often 
reported the equipment was inoperable at the time of reported abuses.</p>
<p>Under the criminal code, all public officials are subject to 
prosecution for abuse or torture, including both physical and 
psychological abuse. The maximum punishment for torture is a five-year 
prison sentence or life in prison if the victim dies as a result of 
torture. Although officials are liable for intentional infliction of 
severe bodily injury, prosecutions of this crime were rare. The law 
states that prohibited acts do not constitute a crime when committed in 
accordance with an order given by a superior in the course of official 
duties. The law provides that the person who gave an illegal order is 
criminally liable for the harm caused, but prosecutions were rare. 
According to the NHRC, prosecutors, and judges, the law effectively 
provides immunity to officials allegedly engaged in coercing confessions
 at the behest of investigators or prosecutors. The NHRC also indicated 
authorities sometimes abandoned complaints of alleged psychological 
torture either for lack of evidence or because the degree of injury 
could not be determined. Moreover, witnesses were generally themselves 
detainees or prisoners and were under great pressure not to testify, 
including by threats against family or of additional charges with 
potentially longer sentences.</p>
<p>As of September 1, the IAAC had received one complaint of rape by 
police or correctional officials, which it sent back to the prosecutorâs
 office for referral to the relevant related government body due to lack
 of IAAC jurisdiction.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h3>

					
					<p>Conditions in prisons and detention centers were often harsh due
 to lack of investment in the prison system; inadequate health care, 
sanitation, and food; poor infrastructure; and lack of security and 
control.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: Authorities assigned male prisoners a 
security level based on the severity of their crimes and held them in a 
prison of the corresponding security level. There was only one prison 
for women, with separate facilities for different security levels, as 
well as a facility for female prisoners with infant children. 
Authorities held pretrial detainees in separate facilities from 
convicted prisoners.</p>
<p>The 23 prisons and 26 pretrial detention centers administered by the 
General Executive Agency of Court Decisions (GEACD) were generally not 
overcrowded. Nonetheless, NGOs and government officials reported that in
 the five older pretrial detention centers in rural areas, insufficient 
medical care, clothing, bedding, food, potable water, heating, lighting,
 ventilation, sanitary facilities, and accommodations for persons with 
disabilities were often problems. Conditions in some police-operated 
alcohol detoxification centers were poor.</p>
<p>The GEACD reported seven deaths in prisons and three deaths in 
pretrial detention facilities as of September 1. According to the GEACD,
 31 prisoners had contracted tuberculosis as of September 1. The GEACD 
indicated it provided funding for a new facility to treat prisoners with
 tuberculosis. Correctional officials routinely released terminally ill 
patients shortly before death, which NGOs alleged led to misleadingly 
low prisoner death statistics.</p>
<p>On February 23, former Supreme Court judge Ch. Byambaa died at 
pretrial detention center No. 461, where she had been detained for 48 
hours on suspicion of involvement in a bribery scheme related to a 
silver mine. The GEACD stated her death was a suicide. Investigations 
into officers responsible for monitoring Byambaa when she was in 
detention continued.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: The Prosecutor Generalâs Office monitors 
prison and detention center conditions. The Prosecutor Generalâs Office 
and the NHRC conducted multiple scheduled, unplanned, and 
complaint-based inspections of prisons, pretrial detention centers, and 
police detention centers.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: The government allowed access by 
independent nongovernmental observers and the NHRC, but authorities 
sometimes limited the areas observers could visit.</p>
<p><u>Improvements</u>: According to the NHRC chief commissioner, 
conditions generally improved in the countryâs 23 prisons and 26 
pretrial detention centers as a result of building renovations.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides that no person shall be arrested, detained, or 
deprived of liberty except by specified procedures and provides for the 
right of any person to challenge the lawfulness of his or her arrest or 
detention in court. Government agencies generally observed these 
requirements. The General Intelligence Agency sometimes detained 
suspects for questioning without charge, but the criminal code requires 
that a prosecutor supervise all detention.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>An evidence-based, prosecutor-approved warrant is generally 
required to arrest a suspect on criminal grounds. Within 24 hours of an 
arrest, a prosecutor must present a request stating the grounds and 
reasons for the arrest to a judge, who must decide within 48 hours 
whether to prolong the detention or release the suspect. The arresting 
authority must notify a suspectâs family within six hours of an arrest. A
 âpressing circumstancesâ exception in the law allows police to arrest 
suspects without a warrant. Examples of exceptions include murder or 
grave bodily injury, serious property damage, hot pursuit of a fleeing 
suspect, and suspicion that destruction of evidence would occur. In such
 cases a prosecutor must approve the arrest within 24 hours, and a judge
 must approve the arrest within the normal 48-hour period. If 72 hours 
pass after an arrest and a judge has not made a decision, police must 
release the suspect. Upon release, authorities must inform the suspect 
of the reasons for the arrest and detention.</p>
<p>The NHRC received seven complaints of illegal arrest, arbitrary 
detention, and extended imprisonment as of September 1. It reported that
 when conducting investigations, investigative agencies occasionally 
detained suspects without judicial authorization, sometimes secretly, 
and police employed such practices despite the availability of other 
methods of restraint, including bail, another personâs personal 
guarantee, and military surveillance. The personal guarantee system 
allows relatives to vouch for an accused family member. Unlike bail, the
 system does not involve pledged security in exchange for release. This 
system is available for all crimes, although authorities usually applied
 it to those accused of less serious offenses.</p>
<p>Authorities generally charged and informed detainees of the charges 
promptly and advised them of their right to counsel. Maximum pretrial 
detention with a court order is 18 months. Detainees generally had 
prompt access to family members, although repeated transfers or 
detention in remote locations undermined this right.</p>
<p>A detainee has the right to an attorney during pretrial detention and
 all subsequent stages of the legal process, including after sentencing.
 If a defendant does not engage an attorney, the government must appoint
 one if the defendant has a physical or mental disability that would 
hinder self-defense, is a minor, is not proficient in the Mongolian 
language, or has a conflict of interest with the defense counsel or 
other defendants. The law does not require the government to provide a 
lawyer for an indigent defendant. Detainees were generally aware of 
their right to legal counsel, but misperceptions limited their use of 
this right. For example, detainees were frequently unaware they could 
exercise this right from the start of the legal process and frequently 
did not assert it unless and until their cases reached trial.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, 
but NGOs and private businesses reported that judicial corruption and 
third-party influence continued. Courts rarely entered not guilty 
verdicts or dismissed criminal charges over the objection of 
prosecutors, even when full trials had produced no substantial evidence 
of guilt. Courts often returned criminal cases to prosecutors when 
acquittal appeared more appropriate. Consequently, some serious criminal
 cases cycled for years between prosecutors and the courts without 
resolution.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Trial Procedures</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the right to a fair and public trial 
without undue delay, and the judiciary generally enforced this right. 
Passage by parliament on March 27 of amendments to the Law on the Legal 
Status of Judges, the Law on Public Prosecutorâs Office, and the 
Anticorruption Law weakened the independence of the judiciary. The 
amendments gave the National Security Council, which comprises the 
president, prime minister, and speaker of the parliament, the authority 
to: (1) recommend the suspension of senior judges, subject to the 
approval of the Judicial General Council; (2) recommend the dismissal of
 the prosecutor and deputy prosecutor general; and (3) recommend the 
dismissal of IAAC officials, subject to approval of the parliament. The 
parliament cited national security concerns to justify adopting the 
amendment without first submitting it to a hearing and public 
consultation as required under normal legislative procedure. On March 
28, the chief justice of the Supreme Court was suspended, and the 
prosecutor general and the deputy prosecutor general were dismissed. In 
May the head and deputy head of the IAAC were dismissed, and in June 
another 17 judges were suspended.</p>
<p>Defendants are presumed innocent and have the right to be informed of
 the charges against them and to a fair, timely, and public trial. 
Courts provide free interpretation services as needed, including sign 
language interpretation, unless a court decides to recover procedural 
expenses from a defendant found guilty. The law also extends to all 
defendants the right to be present at their own trial in the court of 
first instance (but not during appeals); to communicate with an attorney
 of their choice (or one provided at public expense); to receive 
adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense; to confront 
witnesses; to present oneâs own witnesses and evidence; not to be 
compelled to testify or confess guilt; and to appeal. NGOs and observers
 reported that authorities sometimes did not observe these rights and 
that bribery of judges, prosecutors, and expert witnesses sometimes 
contributed to unwarranted convictions, dismissals, or reductions of 
sentences.</p>
<p>Procedural due process errors and inconsistencies often affected 
trials. Although the number of government-provided defense lawyers was 
adequate, their quality and experience were inconsistent, and many 
defendants lacked adequate legal representation. Judges often relied on 
confessions with little corroborating evidence. Furthermore, NGOs 
reported witness intimidation by government authorities and police, 
limited public access to trials (often due to lack of space), a lack of 
transparency in courtsâ decision-making processes, and a low level of 
awareness regarding new criminal and procedural laws.</p>

traditional pasturelands. Some herders reported they were forced to 
relocate after their pastureland was sold and mining companies denied 
them access to water wells. In one case the government confiscated land 
that had been illegally seized by a mining company, returned it to state
 ownership, and made it available for use by local herders.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for freedom of expression, including for the 
press, and the government generally respected this right. The government
 imposed content restrictions in some instances, licensing occasionally 
proved problematic, and there was reported harassment of journalists.</p>
<p><u>Press and Media</u><u>, Including Online Media</u>: Globe 
International, a local NGO specializing in freedom of the press and 
media, reported continued pressure from police, politicians, and large 
business entities on local media and press outlets. The ownership and 
political affiliations of media often were not disclosed to the public, 
and in a 2018-19 survey by Globe International, seven of 10 journalists 
reported that at least once in their career state officials did not 
respond to their requests for information that by law should have been 
publicly available.</p>
<p><u>Violence and Harassment</u>: Some journalists reported they faced 
violence, harassment, or intimidation by police. For example, according 
to a Globe International survey, 67 percent of journalists said they had
 experienced some form of threat or intimidation in connection with 
their reporting at least once in their career.</p>
<p><u>Censorship or Content Restrictions</u>: Communications Regulatory 
Commission (CRC) regulations on digital content and television and radio
 service impose content restrictions in broad terms, for example on 
extreme violence. The government appoints members of the CRC, which 
grants television and radio broadcast licenses without public 
consultation. This process, together with a lack of transparency during 
the license-tendering process, inhibited fair access to broadcast 
frequencies and benefited those with political connections. This also 
contributed to some self-censorship by journalists.</p>
<p><u>Libel/Slander Laws</u>: The law treats libel and slander as petty 
offenses, except during an election campaign period (typically 18 days),
 when they are treated as criminal offenses. Libel and slander cases, 
when prosecuted as petty offenses, are punishable by fines ranging from 
two million to 20 million tugriks ($730 to $7,300). When prosecuted as 
criminal offenses, they are punishable by fines ranging from 450,000 to 
5.4 million tugriks ($164 to $1,970), or imprisonment from one month to 
one year. If a media organization is found guilty of libel or slander 
during an election campaign period, its license can be suspended for six
 months.</p>
<p>The law allows media organizations to seek redress against a person 
who, by threats of violence, attempted bribery, or other means of 
intimidation, seeks to compel them to withhold critical information 
about that person. In such cases the media organization may pursue 
criminal charges or file a civil complaint against the alleged offender.
 If convicted, that person is subject to a fine of 450,000 to 2.7 
million tugriks ($164 to $985), revocation of the right to travel from 
one to six months, and one to six monthsâ imprisonment.</p>
<p>Press representatives and individuals who had a large social media 
following but were not associated with a media organization faced libel 
complaints by government authorities and private persons or 
organizations. Globe International expressed concern about efforts by 
some government authorities to make all libel and slander cases criminal
 offenses. In July the Presidentâs Office sued a civil rights activist 
for defamation based on her critical social media postings. According to
 Globe International, government officials increasingly used defamation 
lawsuits against journalists and independent social media personalities.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Internet Freedom</h3>

					
					<p>By law individuals and groups may engage in the peaceful 
expression of views on the internet. The government maintained a list of
 blocked websites and added sites to the list for alleged violations of 
relevant laws and regulations, including those relating to intellectual 
property. Through the end of September, the government had blocked an 
additional 44 websites.</p>
<p>A CRC regulation places broad restrictions on inappropriate content 
without defining objectionable content explicitly. The regulation 
requires websites with heavy traffic to use filtering software that 
makes publicly visible the internet protocol addresses of those 
commenting or sharing content.</p>
<p>In September police opened investigations into two prominent social 
media users, reportedly based on complaints from another government 
agency and in response to posts they had made in advance of an official 
visit to the country by President Putin of Russia. The two users 
reported official intimidation and threats, but their social media 
accounts remained active.</p>

respected these rights.</p>
<p><u>In-</u><u>country </u><u>Movement</u>: In November authorities 
lifted an order that had suspended migration to Ulaanbaatar. The 
suspension had aimed to curb air and environmental pollution and to ease
 traffic. While in effect, the order had exempted persons traveling to 
Ulaanbaatar for medical treatment or for work for longer than six 
months.</p>
<p><u>Foreign Travel</u>: Under the criminal code, at the request of the
 Prosecutor Generalâs Office, courts can ban the departure of persons 
who are plotting criminal activity. The law requires that those subject 
to an exit ban receive timely notification. Authorities did not allow 
persons under exit bans to leave until the disputes leading to the bans 
were resolved administratively or by court decision, and bans may remain
 in place for years. According to reports, 500 persons, including 
several foreign residents, were banned from leaving the country in 2018,
 and the practice continued during the year.</p>

the country while UNHCR adjudicated their refugee claims. The law 
establishes deportation criteria and permits the Agency for Foreign 
Citizens and Naturalization (the countryâs immigration agency) to deport
 asylum seekers who it deems do not qualify.</p>
<p><u>Employment</u>: The law does not afford a specific legal status to
 refugees and asylum seekers. Authorities usually treated them as 
irregular migrants and did not issue them work permits.</p>
<p><u>Access to Basic Services</u>: Because the law does not provide for
 refugee status, asylum seekers generally did not have access to 
government-provided basic services such as health care and education. 
Refugees and asylum seekers could access private medical facilities with
 UNHCR support.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-3__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Elections and Political Participation</h3>

					
					<p><u>Recent Elections</u>: The most recent national elections were
 the 2017 presidential election and the 2016 parliamentary elections. In
 a 2017 report, an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(OSCE) limited election observation mission assessed the presidential 
election as orderly and efficient. The mission, however, noted 
allegations of vote-buying and candidatesâ involvement in corruption 
during the presidential election. The OSCE noted there was legal 
uncertainty surrounding the first-ever presidential runoff in 2017 
because the electoral legal framework contained few runoff provisions. 
While the General Election Commission issued clarifying regulations in a
 timely manner, there was a widespread perception that political parties
 blurred the line between governing and campaigning during nonelection 
periods.</p>
<p><u>Participation of Women and Minorities</u>: No laws limit 
participation of women or members of minorities in the political 
process, and they did participate. According to the general election 
law, at least 20 percent of candidates nominated by a political party or
 coalition for local and national political office must be women; 
political parties generally complied with this requirement. For example,
 in the 2016 parliamentary election, 16 of 76 (22 percent) of the 
candidates nominated by the Mongolian Peopleâs Party were women.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-4" class="report__section-title">Section 4. Corruption and Lack of Transparency in Government</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for corruption by officials,
 but the government did not always implement the law effectively, and 
corruption continued at all levels. Some officials engaged in corrupt 
practices with impunity. The government implemented the third year of a 
six-year action plan, the National Program Combatting Corruption, 
adopted in 2016. The criminal code contains liability provisions for 
corruption and corruption-related offenses for public servants and 
government officials. For example, the code dictates that those 
sentenced for corruption may not work in public service.</p>
<p>On March 27, the parliament adopted amendments to the Anticorruption Law (see section 1.c.).</p>
<p>The criminal code offers immunity from punishment to anyone who 
reported they bribed an official at the officialâs request. In addition,
 the law criminalizes the misuse of an official position to offer or 
give preference to close associates or family members when awarding 
contracts. Nonetheless, private enterprises reported instances in which 
government employees pressured them to pay bribes to act on 
applications, obtain permits, and complete registrations.</p>
<p>Members of parliament are generally immune from arrest and searches 
of their homes and offices during their tenure, but this immunity may be
 removed by court order, and there is no immunity from criminal 
investigation. Members of parliament who are caught at the scene of a 
crime with damaging evidence against them enjoy no immunity.</p>
<p>Factors contributing to corruption included conflicts of interest, 
lack of transparency, lack of access to information, an inadequate civil
 service system, and weak government control of key institutions. The 
government took measures to improve transparency, including implementing
 electronic tenders for most government procurement and contracting.</p>
<p>The IAAC is the principal agency responsible for investigating 
corruption, assisted at times by the National Police Agencyâs Economic 
Crime Division of the Criminal Police Department for more routine cases.
 The IAAC has investigatory responsibility for corruption and crimes 
committed by military personnel and on-duty police officers. Although 
questions about the IAACâs political impartiality persisted, the public 
viewed the agency as effective. It utilized a standard operating 
procedure to guide the handling of investigations of corruption 
allegations and maintained a blacklist of companies that violated 
government procurement rules. The IAAC conducted 64 training sessions 
for 4,947 public officials and regularly sponsored public awareness 
campaigns on television, in social media, and in press conferences that 
highlighted its work.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: Corruption at all levels of government remained 
widespread. The politicization of anticorruption efforts presented an 
obstacle to effectively addressing corruption. In January, following 
November 2018 allegations by investigative journalists that at least 14 
members of parliament (including two cabinet ministers) and other 
high-level officials had illegally channeled millions of dollars from a 
government fund to families and friends, the Parliamentary Immunity 
Subcommittee rejected a request by the Prosecutor Generalâs Office to 
deny four members of parliament immunity from investigation in 
connection with the scandal. The same month parliament expelled the 
speaker due to his alleged involvement in a separate 2016 corruption 
scandal. In July a former energy minister was convicted of abuse of 
power and sentenced to four yearsâ imprisonment for violating 
procurement regulations and accepting nearly $100,000 in bribes.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: The law requires civil servants and 
elected officials to report assets and outside sources of income for 
themselves, their spouses, parents, children, and live-in siblings. It 
also aims to prevent conflicts of interest between official duties and 
the private interests of those in public service roles, and to regulate 
and monitor conflicts of interest to specify that officials act in the 
public interest. The law requires candidates for public office to submit
 financial statements and questionnaires on personal business interests.</p>
<p>Public officials must electronically file a private interest 
declaration with the IAAC within 30 days of appointment or election and 
annually thereafter during their terms of public service. The law 
provides that such declarations be accessible to the public and 
prescribes a range of administrative sanctions and disciplinary actions 
in case of violation. Violators may receive formal warnings, face salary
 reductions, or be dismissed from their positions. The IAAC is required 
to review the asset declarations of public servants, including police 
officers and members of the military. According to the IAAC, public 
officials are required to file the documentation in a timely manner or 
be subject to fines, dismissal from their positions, or both. The IAAC 
made public the financial disclosure short forms for approximately 
36,794 of the countryâs public officials. The IAAC received a 20 percent
 increase in complaints related to alleged conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Officials with authority to spend government funds are required to 
report expenditures and audit results on their ministry and agency 
websites. All transactions more than one million tugriks ($365) are 
subject to reporting. Plans for budgets, loans, or bonds must be 
registered with the Ministry of Finance for monitoring and tracking, 
even after the originating officials have left their positions.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-5" class="report__section-title">Section 5. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Abuses of Human Rights</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A variety of domestic and international human rights groups 
generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
were sometimes cooperative and responsive to their views.</p>
<p>Amnesty International has received reports of discrimination, 
intimidation, harassment, police intimidation, and stigmatization 
against human rights organizations. Progovernment actors sometimes 
characterized such NGOs as âundesirables,â âtroublemakers,â âforeign 
agents,â or âopponents of the state.â</p>
<p><u>Government Human Rights Bodies</u>: The NHRC is responsible for 
monitoring human rights abuses, initiating and reviewing policy changes,
 and coordinating with human rights NGOs. The NHRC consists of three 
senior commissioners nominated by the president, the Supreme Court, and 
parliament, respectively, for six-year terms. Officials reported 
government funding for the NHRC, provided by parliament, remained 
inadequate, and inspection, training, and public awareness activities 
were entirely dependent on external funding sources. The NHRC 
consistently supported politically contentious human rights issues, such
 as the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or intersex 
(LGBTI) individuals, persons with disabilities, and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>There was some collaboration between the government and civil society
 in discussing human rights problems. NGOs and international 
organizations noted, however, that government officials were less open 
to including NGOs in the legislative drafting process and in the 
preparation of official reports on social and human rights problems.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-6" class="report__section-title">Section 6. Discrimination, Societal Abuses, and Trafficking in Persons</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">Women</h3>

					
					<p><u>Rape and Domestic Violence</u>: The criminal code 
criminalizes sexual intercourse through physical violence or threat of 
violence and provides for sentences of one to 20 yearsâ imprisonment or 
life imprisonment, depending on the circumstances. The criminal code 
criminalizes spousal rape. Domestic violence is also a crime, for which 
perpetrators can be punished administratively or criminally, including 
in the latter case by a maximum of two yearsâ imprisonment. The 
government maintains a nationwide database of domestic violence 
offenders, and those who commit a second domestic violence offense are 
automatically charged under criminal law.</p>
<p>The nongovernmental National Center against Violence (NCAV) reported 
that police response to domestic violence complaints improved. The law 
provides alternative protection measures for victims of domestic abuse, 
such as restraining orders.</p>
<p>Despite continued attention, domestic violence remained a serious and
 widespread problem. The NCAV reported increased reporting of domestic 
violence by third parties. Combating domestic violence is included in 
the accredited training curriculum of the police academy and in all 
police officer position descriptions.</p>
<p>The NCAV expanded its activities designed to support victims, 
including training for medical personnel who delivered services to deaf 
victims of domestic violence.</p>
<p>According to the NCAV, there were 14 shelters and 14 one-stop service
 centers for domestic violence survivors run by a variety of NGOs, local
 government agencies, and hospitals. The one-stop service centers, 
located primarily at hospitals, provided emergency shelter for a maximum
 of 72 hours. The relatively small number of shelters located in rural 
areas presented a challenge for domestic violence victims in those 
areas.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Harassment</u>: The criminal code does not address sexual 
harassment. NGOs said there was a lack of awareness and consensus within
 society of what constituted inappropriate behavior, making it difficult
 to gauge the extent of the problem. As of September 1, the NHRC had 
received 43 sexual harassment complaints. Upon receiving such a 
complaint, the NHRC may perform an investigation, after which it may 
send a letter to the employer recommending administrative sanctions be 
levied against the accused party.</p>
<p><u>Coercion in Population Control</u>: There were no reports of coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: The law provides the same legal status and 
rights to women and men, including equal pay for equal work and equal 
access to education. These rights were generally observed, although 
women faced discrimination in employment. As of September 1, the NHRC 
had received seven complaints of discrimination. It does not 
disaggregate cases of discrimination on the basis of gender, race, 
religion, or sexual orientation. Government statistics report a pay 
disparity of about 20 percent during the first half of the year.</p>
<p>The law sets mandatory minimum quotas for women in the government and
 political parties. It also outlaws discrimination based on sex, 
appearance, or age, although some NGOs noted authorities did not enforce
 this provision. The law provides that women must comprise at least 15 
percent of political appointees to government positions at the national,
 provincial, and capital city levels; 20 percent at the district level; 
and 30 percent at subdistrict levels. The law also requires that women 
must represent at least 25 percent of a political partyâs senior 
leadership. Women were underrepresented at the highest levels of 
government; only one of the countryâs 16 cabinet ministers is a woman.</p>
<p>In most cases the divorced wife retained custody of any children; 
divorced husbands often failed to pay child support and did so without 
penalty. Womenâs activists said that because family businesses and 
properties usually were registered under the husbandâs name, ownership 
continued to be transferred automatically to the former husband in 
divorce cases.</p>
<p>No separate government agency oversees womenâs rights, but the 
National Committee on Gender Equality, chaired by the prime minister and
 overseen by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, coordinates 
policy and womenâs interests among ministries, NGOs, and gender councils
 at the provincial and local levels. The governmentâs <i>National Program on Gender Equality 2017-21</i> and its related action plan seek the economic empowerment of women and equal participation in political and public life.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Children</h3>

					
					<p><u>Birth Registration</u>: Citizenship derives from oneâs 
parents. Births are immediately registered and a registration number 
issued through an online system jointly developed by the Ministry of 
Health, the National Statistics Office, and the State Registration 
Agency. Failure to register could result in the denial of public 
services.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: The criminal code includes a specific chapter on 
crimes against children, including forced begging, abandonment, inducing
 addiction, engaging children in criminal activity or pornography, and 
the trafficking and abuse of children.</p>
<p>Child abuse was a significant problem and consisted principally of 
domestic violence and sexual abuse. The governmentâs Family, Child, and 
Youth Development Authority (FCYDA) and the NCAV noted that reporting of
 child abuse increased following enactment of obligatory reporting laws.
 The FCYDA also noted its continued operation of a hotline to report 
child abuse, an emergency service center, and a shelter for child 
victims of abuse. The FCYDA also said it provided funding to an NGO in 
Ulaanbaatar to run additional shelters to which it referred child 
victims of abuse. According to an NGO, space was inadequate for the 
number of child abuse victims referred for long-term care.</p>
<p>Child abandonment was also a problem. Some children were orphaned or 
ran away from home because of neglect or parental abuse. Police 
officials stated they sent children of abusive parents to shelters, but 
some observers indicated many youths were returned to abusive parents. 
According to the NGOs, as of November 1, there were 1,067 children 
living in 31 childcare centers across the country. This number includes 
both child victims of abuse and orphans, as the FCYDA does not 
disaggregate the data. More children were referred to long-term care 
than there was space available.</p>
<p>Each province and all of Ulaanbaatarâs district police offices had a 
specialized police officer appointed to investigate crimes against, or 
committed by, juveniles. The international NGO Save the Children 
implemented a program that facilitates annualâand sometimes more 
frequentâinteragency meetings on preventing child abuse at local 
administrative units across the country. Police were active in campaigns
 to improve the safety of children and broadcast a variety of 
public-service announcements through television and radio programs and 
commercials.</p>
<p><u>Early and Forced Marriage</u>: The legal minimum age for marriage 
is 18, with court-approved exceptions for minors age 16 to 18 who obtain
 the consent of parents or guardians.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: Although illegal, the 
commercial sexual exploitation of children younger than 18 was a 
problem. According to NGOs there were instances in which teenage girls 
were kidnapped, coerced, or deceived and forced to work in prostitution.
 The minimum age for consensual sex is 16. Violators of the statutory 
rape law (defined as sexual intercourse with a person younger than 16 
not involving physical violence or the threat of violence) are subject 
to a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Those who engaged children
 in prostitution or sexual exploitation are subject to a maximum penalty
 of 20 years in prison, or life imprisonment if aggravating 
circumstances are present. Under the criminal code, the maximum penalty 
for engaging children in pornography is eight yearsâ imprisonment. The 
NCAV reported it had received 16 complaints related to child sexual 
abuse and domestic violence as of November 1. Ten of the cases were 
referred to the courts, five were referred to the FCYDA, and one case 
was pending.</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is not a party to 
the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs <i>Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction</i> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200914154336/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data/reported-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Persons with Disabilities</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination against persons with 
disabilities, defining these as restrictions due to permanent impairment
 of the body or intellectual, mental, or sensory capacities. 
Discrimination in employment against persons with disabilities was 
common, despite the law.</p>
<p>Most government buildings remained inaccessible to wheelchairs, and 
only a few intersections in Ulaanbaatar were equipped with auditory 
crosswalks to aid pedestrians with visual impairments.</p>
<p>There is no explicit prohibition of discrimination in education, but 
the law charges the government with creating conditions to provide 
students with disabilities an education. Children with disabilities are 
by law allowed to attend mainstream schools but faced significant 
barriers to education. Schools often lacked trained staff and the 
infrastructure to accommodate children with disabilities. In May the 
Ministry of Education, Culture, Science, and Sports issued an order 
requiring the retrofitting of mainstream schools to ensure inclusive 
education and accessibility for children with disabilities. Although the
 majority of children with disabilities entered the public-school system
 at the appropriate age, the dropout rate increased as the children 
aged. Children with disabilities in rural areas were more likely to drop
 out of school because most schools for students with disabilities were 
in Ulaanbaatar.</p>
<p>Although the law mandates standards for physical access to new public
 buildings and a representative of persons with disabilities serves on 
the state commission for inspecting standards of new buildings, most new
 buildings were not constructed in compliance with the law. Public 
transport remained largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. 
Emergency services were often inaccessible to blind and deaf persons 
because service providers lacked trained personnel and appropriate 
technologies. Moreover, domestic violence shelters were not accessible 
to persons with disabilities.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h3>

					
					<p>The criminal code prohibits discrimination based on sexual 
orientation, gender identity, nationality, language, race, age, gender, 
social status, professional position, religion, education, or medical 
status. Violators are subject to a maximum penalty of five yearsâ 
imprisonment. As of September 1, at least one case was known to have 
been prosecuted under the law.</p>
<p>LGBTI individuals faced violence and discrimination both in public 
and at home based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. There 
were reports LGBTI persons faced greater discrimination and fear in 
rural areas than in Ulaanbaatar due to less public awareness and limited
 online media accessibility in rural areas. LGBT Centre, an NGO, 
received reports of violence against LGBTI persons, most involving young
 persons coming out to their families or whose families discovered they 
were LGBTI.</p>
<p>An NGO noted that despite increased police awareness of abuses faced 
by the LGBTI community and capacity to respond to problems affecting 
LGBTI persons, there were still reported cases involving police 
harassment of LGBTI victims of alleged crimes. Authorities frequently 
dismissed charges when a crime victim was an LGBTI person.</p>
<p>In September, Bosoo Huh Mongol, a nationalist group, posted a live 
video on Facebook identifying members of the transgender community and 
threatening them with physical violence and public exposure. After the 
National Police Agency conducted a criminal investigation, the leader of
 the group was arrested in Uvs Province and sent to detention for 30 
days. The case remained pending with a court of first instance in 
Ulaanbaatar as of November 13.</p>
<p>There were reports of discrimination against LGBTI persons in employment.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the right of workers to form or join 
independent unions and professional organizations of their choosing 
without previous authorization or excessive requirements. The law 
provides for the rights of all workers except those employed in 
essential services to participate in union activities without 
discrimination, conduct strikes, and bargain collectively. The law 
requires reinstatement of workers fired for union activity.</p>
<p>The law bars persons employed in essential servicesâdefined as 
occupations critical for national defense and safety, including police, 
utilities, and transportation servicesâfrom striking, and it prohibits 
third parties from organizing strikes. The law prohibits strikes 
unrelated to matters regulated by a collective agreement.</p>
<p>Laws providing for the rights of collective bargaining and freedom of
 association generally were enforced. Penalties, largely fines, for 
violations of freedom of association and collective bargaining 
provisions were not sufficient to deter violations. Labor dispute 
settlement committees resolved most disputes between individual workers 
and management. These committees comprise representatives of the local 
government, the employer, and the employee, who is joined by a 
representative of the Confederation of Mongolian Trade Unions (CMTU). 
The CMTU reported the court process was so lengthy many workers 
abandoned their cases due to time and expense.</p>
<p>The CMTU stated some employees faced obstacles, including the threat 
of salary deductions, to forming, joining, or participating in unions. 
Some employers prohibited workers from participating in union activities
 during work hours. The CMTU also stated workers terminated for union 
activity were not always reinstated. The CMTU further reported some 
employers took steps to weaken existing unions. For example, some 
companies used the portion of employeesâ salaries deducted for union 
dues for other purposes and did not forward the monies to the unions. 
The CMTU also reported some employers refused to conclude collective 
bargaining agreements.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law does not prohibit all the worst forms of child labor. 
The law prohibits children younger than 14 from working. At age 14, 
children may, with parental and government permission, work a maximum of
 30 hours per week, to acquire vocational training and work experience. 
At age 15, children may establish a vocational training contract with 
permission from parents or guardians. According to a Ministry of Labor 
and Social Protection order, children younger than 18 may not work in 
hazardous occupations such as mining and construction; engage in arduous
 work; serve as jockeys during the winter (children may be jockeys 
beginning at age seven during other seasons); participate in cultural, 
circus, or folk art performances at night; work in businesses that sell 
alcoholic beverages; or engage in roadside vending. Despite these 
restrictions, children were commonly seen participating in horse racing,
 roadside vending, and other occupations in contravention of the order.</p>
<p>Authorities reported employers often did not follow the law, 
requiring minors to work in excess of 40 hours per week and paying them 
less than the minimum wage.</p>
<p>The criminal codeâs child protection provisions cover hazardous child
 labor, which is punishable by severe penalties that are not sufficient 
to deter violations due to ineffective enforcement. The government did 
not effectively enforce the law.</p>
<p>The government convenes a council on trafficking in persons on a 
monthly basis. Despite government programs to support the employment of 
adult family members, unemployment remains a problem.</p>
<p>Child labor, including cases of forced child labor, was suspected in 
many sectors, including hotels and restaurants, vehicle repair, 
manufacturing, petty trade, scavenging and forced begging, event or 
street contortionism (a local art form), and the illicit sex trade (see 
section 6, Children). The FCYDA and the General Agency for Specialized 
Inspection (GASI) conducted child labor inspections, including at 
artisanal mining sites, public markets, service centers, dumpsites, 
construction and transportation sites, and on farms.</p>
<p>International organizations continued to express concern about child 
jockeys in horseracing. Children commonly learned to ride horses at age 
four or five, and young children traditionally served as jockeys during 
the annual Naadam festival in races ranging from two to 20 miles. All 
jockeys including child jockeys are prohibited from working from 
November 1 to May 1, when cold weather makes racing more hazardous.</p>
<p>The regulations also require registration, adequate headgear, and 
chest protection, but despite greater government and public attention to
 safety, enforcement was inconsistent. GASI reported that in sanctioned 
races during the year, there were 49,641 instances of a child competing 
in a race (children who raced more than once were counted multiple 
times). In these races, 550 children fell from horses, 166 were slightly
 injured, and 12 were seriously injured. The number of deaths was not 
reported, and races not sanctioned were not counted in these statistics.
 The FCYDA maintained an electronic database containing information on 
more than 10,325 child jockeys and collected biometric information to 
better track jockeys and prevent children younger than seven years from 
working as jockeys. In addition the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Protection established guidelines requiring the purchase and maintenance
 of an insurance policy for jockeys that costs 100,000 tugriks ($37) and
 pays to jockeys or their surviving family members up to 20 million 
tugriks ($7,300) in case of injury or death sustained during a race. 
Observers reported compliance with safety regulations at national races,
 but less satisfactory compliance at community and regional events. The 
government, however, only conducts child labor inspections at horse 
racing events once a year and must provide 48 hoursâ notice before 
conducting an investigation.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination in employment and occupation 
based on nationality, language, race, age, gender, sexual orientation, 
sex or marital status, social origin or status, wealth, religion, 
ideology, education, or medical status. It also prohibits employers from
 refusing to employ a person with disabilities but provides broad 
exceptions, applying âunless the condition of such person prevents him 
from performing a specified activity or would otherwise be contrary to 
established working conditions at the workplace.â The law prohibits 
employers from refusing employment to or dismissing an individual 
diagnosed with HIV/AIDS unless the condition makes it difficult to 
perform job duties. The law also prohibits women from working in 
occupations that require heavy labor or exposure to chemicals that could
 affect infant and maternal health.</p>
<p>The government enforced the law in a limited manner, and 
discrimination occurred in employment and occupation based on sex and 
disability, as well as on sexual orientation, gender identity, and HIV 
status. Penalties were not sufficient to deter violations.</p>
<p>The law charges employers with taking steps to prevent sexual 
harassment in the workplace, including by establishing internal rules 
about sexual harassment and the redress of complaints, but provides no 
penalties. The NHRC reported poor knowledge of the lawâs sexual 
harassment provisions among both employers and employees.</p>
<p>The NHRC found employers were less likely to hire, promote, or 
provide professional development opportunities to women. There were also
 reports some employers refused to hire overweight persons, claiming 
they could not perform essential job functions.</p>
<p>Although the law requires workplaces with more than 25 employees to 
employ a minimum of 4 percent of persons with disabilities or pay a 
fine, NGOs reported a reluctance to hire them persisted, and many 
companies preferred to pay the fine. They also noted the government 
itself failed to meet the quota. Members of the disability community 
noted that, even when hired, the lack of accessible public transport 
made it difficult for persons with disabilities to hold a job (see 
section 6, Persons with Disabilities).</p>
<p>The labor ministryâs Department for the Development of Persons with 
Disabilities is responsible for developing and implementing employment 
policies and projects for persons with disabilities. Government 
organizations and NGOs reported employersâ attitude toward employing 
persons with disabilities had not improved and that many employers still
 preferred to pay fines to the Employment Support Fund maintained by the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Protection rather than employ persons with
 disabilities.</p>
<p>NGOs, the NHRC, and members of the LGBTI community reported companies
 rarely hired LGBTI persons who were open about their sexual orientation
 or gender identity, and LGBTI persons who revealed their status in the 
workplace frequently faced discrimination, including the possibility of 
dismissal. Illegally dismissed LGBTI persons rarely sought court 
injunctions to avoid disclosing their status and increasing the risk of 
discrimination.</p>
<p>Foreign migrant workers did not receive the same level of protection against labor law violations as the general population.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>The minimum wage was above the poverty line.</p>
<p>Laws on labor, cooperatives, and enterprises set occupational health 
and safety standards, which apply equally to local and foreign workers. 
GASI noted many standards were outdated.</p>
<p>Labor inspectors assigned to GASIâs regional and local offices are 
responsible for enforcement of all labor regulations and have the 
authority to compel immediate compliance. The government did not 
effectively enforce minimum wage, working hours, and occupational safety
 and health laws and regulations. Neither the penalties nor the number 
of inspectors was sufficient to enforce compliance. GASI reported its 
inspectors, faced with large investigative workloads, needed better 
training on investigative techniques and evidence collection. The number
 of labor inspectors was insufficient for the size of the countryâs 
workforce. Inspectors generally did not conduct inspections in the 
informal sector.</p>
<p>GASI acknowledged that fines imposed on companies for not complying 
with labor standards or for concealing accidents were insufficient to 
induce management to resolve problems. Moreover, safety experts 
responsible for labor safety and health were often inexperienced or had 
not received training. GASI lacks the authority to perform surprise 
inspections.</p>
<p>The law on pensions allows for participation by small family 
businesses and workers in the informal economy (such as herders) in 
pension and social benefit programs. These categories of workers were 
able to access health care, education, social entitlements, and an 
optional form of social security.</p>
<p>Many workers received less than the minimum wage, particularly at 
smaller companies in rural areas. Workers in the construction sector, in
 which work is constrained to a few months each year due to extreme 
winters, were sometimes pressured to work long hours, increasing the 
risk of accidents and injuries.</p>
<p>Many foreign workers, the majority of whom were Chinese mining and 
construction workers, reportedly worked in conditions that did not meet 
government regulations.</p>
<p>Workers from the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of Korea were in the 
country at the beginning of the year, and the government enforced a 
series of deportations in compliance with relevant UN Security Council 
resolutions.</p>
<p>Reliance on outmoded machinery, poor maintenance, and management 
errors led to frequent industrial accidents, particularly in the 
construction, mining, and energy sectors. According to the NHRC, lack of
 proper labor protection and safety procedures made the construction 
sector particularly susceptible to accidents. The CMTU stated workers 
had limited awareness of their legal right to refuse to work in unsafe 
conditions.</p>
<p>GASI provided safety training to companies and private enterprises. 
According to GASI, the training resulted in a decrease in industrial 
accidents in accident-prone sectors such as light industry, food, 
health, and education. According to most recent data provided by GASI, 
17 persons were killed in industrial accidents in 2016. 
Construction-related industrial accidents were especially deadly: 
according to GASI, over the previous 10 years, 246 persons were killed 
in such accidents. According to newspaper reports, four workers died in 
February at a gold mine, and there were other reports that cited 
industrial accidents.</p>
