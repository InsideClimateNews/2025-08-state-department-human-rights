				<h2 id="report-toc__exec-summary" class="report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

				<p>Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty republic. Presidential 
and legislative elections were held in 2018. In June 2018, voters 
elected Ivan Duque Marquez president in a second round of elections that
 observers considered free and fair and the most peaceful in decades.</p>
<p>The Colombian National Police (CNP) force is responsible for internal
 law enforcement and is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of 
Defense. The Migration Directorate, part of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, is the immigration authority. The CNP shares law enforcement 
investigatory duties with the attorney generalâs Corps of Technical 
Investigators. In addition to its responsibility to defend the country 
against external threats, the army shares limited responsibility for law
 enforcement and maintenance of order within the country. For example, 
military units sometimes provided logistical support and security for 
criminal investigators to collect evidence in high-conflict or remote 
areas. Civilian authorities generally maintained effective control over 
security forces.</p>
<p>Significant human rights issues included: reports of unlawful or 
arbitrary killings; reports of torture and arbitrary detention by both 
government security forces and illegal armed groups; criminalization of 
libel; widespread corruption; rape and abuse of women and children by 
illegal armed groups; violence and threats of violence against human 
rights defenders and social leaders; violence against and forced 
displacement of Afro-Colombian and indigenous persons; violence against 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons; forced child 
labor; and killings and other violence against trade unionists.</p>
<p>The government took steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish 
officials who committed human rights abuses, although some cases 
experienced long delays that raised concerns about accountability.</p>
<p>The National Liberation Army (ELN) perpetrated armed attacks across 
the country during the year, including a car bomb attack on a police 
academy in Bogota that killed 22 persons. Other illegal armed groups, 
including dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC) and drug-trafficking gangs, continued to operate. Illegal armed 
groups, as well as narcotics traffickers, were significant perpetrators 
of human rights abuses and violent crimes and committed acts of 
extrajudicial and unlawful killings, extortion, and other abuses, such 
as kidnapping, torture, human trafficking, bombings and use of 
landmines, restriction on freedom of movement, sexual violence, 
recruitment and use of child soldiers, and intimidation of journalists, 
women, and human rights defenders. The government investigated these 
actions and prosecuted those responsible to the extent possible.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were reports that the government or its agents committed 
arbitrary or unlawful killings. According to the nongovernmental 
organization (NGO) Center for Research and Education of the Populace 
(CINEP), from January 1 through August 26, there were 10 cases of 
âintentional deaths of civilians committed by state agents.â</p>
<p>For example, in April the attorney general opened an investigation 
into the killing of Dimar Torres, a demobilized member of the FARC who 
was allegedly shot four times by an army soldier while leaving his 
village to buy tools. According to the Attorney Generalâs Office, 
Colonel Jorge Armando Perez Amezquita planned and ordered the killing. 
The colonelâs involvement was discovered later in the investigation; the
 case against him was initially delayed as authorities deliberated 
whether to proceed in the military or ordinary justice system. In 
November a military judge decided the investigation into the killing of 
Torres, including the case against Colonel Perez, would proceed in the 
ordinary justice system. On November 27, the army soldier who carried 
out the killing was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The 
investigation into the alleged role of the colonel and four other 
soldiers continued as of the end of November.</p>
<p>Illegal armed groups, including the ELN, committed numerous unlawful 
or politically motivated killings, often in areas without a strong 
government presence (see section 1.g.).</p>
<p>Investigations of past killings proceeded, albeit slowly. From 
January 1 through September, the Attorney Generalâs Office registered 
seven new cases of alleged aggravated homicide by state agents. During 
the same period, authorities formally charged eight members of the 
security forces with aggravated homicide or homicide of a civilian, with
 six of those crimes occurring in previous years. The Attorney Generalâs
 Office reported that through August, it obtained two new convictions of
 security force members in cases involving homicide of a âprotected 
personâ (i.e., civilians and others accorded such status under 
international humanitarian law).</p>
<p>Efforts continued to hold officials accountable in âfalse positiveâ 
extrajudicial killings, in which thousands of civilians were killed and 
falsely presented as guerrilla combatants in the late 1990s to early 
2000s. As of June the Attorney Generalâs Office reported the government 
had convicted 1,709 members of the security forces in cases related to 
false positive cases since 2008.</p>
<p>Some human rights organizations alleged that officials recently 
promoted within the senior ranks of the military could be linked to past
 extrajudicial killings.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office reported there were open investigations
 of 20 retired and active-duty generals related to false positive 
killings as of June. The Attorney Generalâs Office also reported there 
were 2,504 open investigations related to false positive killings or 
other extrajudicial killings as of May 20.</p>
<p>In addition, the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), the justice 
component of the Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation, 
and Nonrepetition provided for in the 2016 peace accord with the FARC, 
reviewed some investigations related to false positive or extrajudicial 
killings. This included activities to advance Case 003, focused on 
extrajudicial killings committed by the First, Second, Fourth, and 
Seventh Army Divisions. For example, on April 25, the JEP began to 
review the case against retired general Mario Montoya Uribe for his 
involvement in false positive killings. The JEP also continued to review
 the case against retired general William Henry Torres Escalante. On 
March 5, retired colonel Gabriel Rincon Amado, sentenced in 2017 to 46 
years in prison for his involvement in the false positive killings of 
five men from Soacha, apologized before the relatives of the victims and
 the JEP magistrates and admitted he had a responsibility in the 
killings.</p>
<p>During the year there were allegations that military orders 
instructing army commanders to double the results of their missions 
against guerillas, criminal organizations, and illegal armed groups 
could heighten the risk of civilian casualties. In a July preliminary 
report, an independent commission established by President Duque to 
review the facts regarding these alleged military orders concluded that 
the orders did not permit, suggest, or result in abuses or criminal 
conduct, and that the armed forcesâ operational rules and doctrine were 
aligned with human rights and international humanitarian law principles.
 As of November a final report had not been issued.</p>
<p>Human rights organizations, victims, and government investigators 
accused some members of government security forces of collaborating with
 or tolerating the activities of organized-crime gangs, which included 
some former paramilitary members. According to the Attorney Generalâs 
Office, between January and September, no members of government security
 forces were arrested for ties with illegal armed groups.</p>
<p>According to a March 14 UN report, the UN Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reported 115 verified killings of 
social leaders and human rights defenders in 2018. According to the 
Attorney Generalâs Office, in the cases of 308 killings of human rights 
defenders from January 2016 to August 2019, the government had obtained 
42 convictions, 55 alleged perpetrators had ongoing trials, 41 had been 
charged, and 40 were under investigation. According to the OHCHR, 37 
percent of the killings occurred in the departments of Antioquia, Cauca,
 and Norte de Santander; 27 percent of the killings were of members of 
indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities. The motives of the killings 
varied, and it was often difficult to determine the primary or precise 
motive in individual cases. For example, on June 21, in Tierralta, 
Cordoba, prominent social leader and land rights activist Maria del 
Pilar Hurtado was shot and killed by two men riding a motorcycle. As of 
September authorities had not identified the killers, but the Inspector 
Generalâs Office opened a disciplinary investigation into local public 
officials for alleged irregularities related to the handling of alleged 
threats against the victim.</p>
<p>The Commission of the Timely Action Plan for Prevention and 
Protection for Human Rights Defenders, Social and Communal Leaders, and 
Journalists, created in November 2018, strengthened efforts to 
investigate and prevent attacks against social leaders and human rights 
defenders. The Inspector Generalâs Office and the human rights ombudsman
 continued to raise awareness on the situation of human rights defenders
 through the public âLead Lifeâ campaign, in partnership with civil 
society, media, and international organizations. Additionally, there is 
an elite corps of the National Police, a specialized subdirectorate of 
the National Protection Unit (NPU), a special investigation unit of the 
Attorney Generalâs Office responsible for dismantling criminal 
organizations and enterprises, and a unified command post, which shared 
responsibility for protecting human rights defenders from attacks and 
investigating and prosecuting these cases. The Attorney Generalâs Office
 reported that the combined effort identified or arrested a suspect in 
47 percent of the cases of killings of social leaders and that 255 
persons had been arrested and charged for their involvement in such 
cases.</p>
<p>By law the Attorney Generalâs Office is the primary entity 
responsible for investigating allegations of human rights abuses 
committed by security forces, with the exception of conflict-related 
crimes, which are within the jurisdiction of the JEP. The JEP continued 
investigations of cases opened in 2018 and accepted new cases during the
 year.</p>
<p>Some NGOs complained that military investigators, not members of the 
Attorney Generalâs Office, were sometimes the first responders in cases 
of deaths resulting from actions of security forces and might make 
decisions about possible illegal actions. The government made 
improvements in investigating and trying cases of abuses, but claims of 
impunity for security force members continued. This was due in some 
cases to obstruction of justice and opacity in the process by which 
cases were investigated and prosecuted in the military justice system. 
Inadequate protection of witnesses and investigators, delay tactics by 
defense attorneys, the judiciaryâs failure to exert appropriate controls
 over dockets and case progress, and inadequate coordination among 
government entities that sometimes allowed statutes of limitations to 
expireâresulting in a defendantâs release from jail before trialâwere 
also significant obstacles.</p>
<p>The military justice system functioned under both the old 
inquisitorial and a newer accusatory justice system, which was not 
scheduled to be fully implemented until 2020. Transition to the new 
system continued slowly, and the military had not yet developed an 
interinstitutional strategy for recruiting, hiring, or training 
investigators, crime scene technicians, or forensic specialists, which 
is required under the accusatory system. As such, the military justice 
system did not exercise criminal investigative authority; all new 
criminal investigation duties were conducted by judicial police 
investigators from the CNP and the attorney generalâs Corps of Technical
 Investigators.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Disappearance</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports of disappearances by or on behalf of 
government authorities during the year. According to the National 
Institute of Forensic and Legal Medicine, from January 1 through July 
31, a total of 3,788 cases of disappearances were registered. The 
government did not provide information on the number of victims of 
disappearances who were located.</p>
<p>According to the Attorney Generalâs Office, on April 29, retired 
police general Mauricio Santoyo was arrested for his alleged 
participation in the forced disappearance of two persons in Medellin in 
2000.</p>
<p>In the context of implementation of the 2016 peace accord, the 
government launched the Special Unit for the Search for Disappeared 
Persons in November 2018 to investigate disappearances that occurred 
during the conflict. The unit visited 10 cities throughout the year, 
where teams of forensic scientists began gathering information (see 
section 1.g.).</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>Although the law prohibits such practices, there were reports 
that government officials employed them. CINEP reported that through 
October security forces were allegedly involved in nine cases of 
torture. Members of the military and police accused of torture generally
 were tried in civilian rather than military courts.</p>
<p>Between January and September, the Attorney Generalâs Office did not 
charge any members of the military or police force with torture.</p>
<p>CINEP reported organized-crime gangs and illegal armed groups were 
responsible for four documented cases of torture through October.</p>
<p>According to NGOs monitoring prison conditions, there were numerous 
allegations of sexual and physical violence committed by guards and 
other inmates.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h3>

					
					<p>With the exception of some new facilities, prisons and detention
 centers were harsh and life threatening due to overcrowding, inadequate
 sanitation, poor health care, and lack of other basic services. Poor 
training of officials remained a problem throughout the prison system.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: Overcrowding existed in menâs and in 
womenâs prisons. The National Prison Institute (INPEC), which operated 
the national prisons and oversaw the jails, estimated there were 124,574
 persons incarcerated in 133 prisons at a rate of approximately 50 
percent over capacity.</p>
<p>The law prohibits holding pretrial detainees with convicted 
prisoners, although this frequently occurred. Juvenile detainees were 
held in separate juvenile detention centers. The Superior Judiciary 
Council stated the maximum time that a person may remain in judicial 
detention facilities is three days. The same rules apply to jails 
located inside police stations. These regulations were often violated.</p>
<p>The practice of preventive detention, in combination with 
inefficiencies in the judicial system, continued to exacerbate 
overcrowding. The government continued to implement procedures 
introduced in 2017 that provide for the immediate release of some 
pretrial detainees, including many accused of serious crimes such as 
aggravated robbery and sexual assault.</p>
<p>Physical abuse by prison guards, prisoner-on-prisoner violence, and 
authoritiesâ failure to maintain control were problems. The Inspector 
Generalâs Office continued to investigate allegations that some prison 
guards routinely used excessive force and treated inmates brutally. As 
of July the Inspector Generalâs Office reported disciplinary 
investigations against 20 prison guards for such actions as physical 
abuse and inhuman treatment. In the first six months of the year, INPEC 
carried out 114 disciplinary investigations, related principally to 
physical abuse but also to two cases of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>INPEC reported 103 deaths in prisons, jails, pretrial detention, or 
other detention centers through July 31, including five attributed to 
internal fights.</p>
<p>Many prisoners continued to face difficulties receiving adequate 
medical care. Nutrition and water quality were deficient and contributed
 to the overall poor health of many inmates. Inmates stated authorities 
routinely rationed water in many facilities, which officials attributed 
to city water shortages.</p>
<p>INPECâs physical structures were generally in poor repair. The 
Inspector Generalâs Office noted some facilities had poor ventilation 
and overtaxed sanitary systems. Prisoners in some high-altitude 
facilities complained of inadequate blankets and clothing, while 
prisoners in tropical facilities complained that overcrowding and 
insufficient ventilation contributed to high temperatures in prison 
cells. Some prisoners slept on floors without mattresses, while others 
shared cots in overcrowded cells.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: Authorities investigated credible prisoner 
complaints of mistreatment and inhuman conditions, including complaints 
of prison guards soliciting bribes from inmates, but some prisoners 
asserted the investigations were slow.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: The government permitted independent 
monitoring of prison conditions by local and international human rights 
groups. INPEC required a three-day notice before granting consular 
access. Some NGOs complained that authorities, without adequate 
explanation, denied them access to visit prisoners.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention and provides 
for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness of his or her 
arrest or detention in court. There were allegations, however, that 
authorities detained citizens arbitrarily. CINEP reported 23 cases of 
arbitrary detention committed by state security forces through June 30.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>Authorities must bring detained persons before a judge within 36
 hours to determine the validity of the detention, bring formal charges 
within 30 days, and start a trial within 90 days of the initial 
detention. Public defenders contracted by the Office of the Ombudsman 
assisted indigent defendants but were overloaded with cases. Detainees 
received prompt access to legal counsel and family members as provided 
for by law. Bail was generally available except for serious crimes such 
as murder, rebellion, or narcotics trafficking. Authorities generally 
respected these rights.</p>
<p><u>Arbitrary Arrest</u>: The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and 
detention; however, this requirement was not always respected. NGOs 
characterized some arrests as arbitrary detention, including arrests 
allegedly based on tips from informants about persons linked to 
guerrilla activities, detentions by members of the security forces 
without a judicial order, detentions based on administrative authority, 
detentions during military operations or at roadblocks, large-scale 
detentions, and detentions of persons while they were âexercising their 
fundamental rights.â For example, NGOs alleged that in July government 
forces illegally arrested nine farmers in Bolivar Department. The army 
claimed the farmers were members of the ELN, but protesters alleged 
there was no evidence of an affiliation with armed groups and the 
arrests were based on a stigmatization of rural workers in the region.</p>
<p><u>Pretrial Detention</u>: The judicial process moved slowly, and the
 civilian judicial system suffered from a significant backlog of cases, 
which led to large numbers of pretrial detainees. Of the 124,574 prison 
detainees, 41,802 were in pretrial detention. The failure of many local 
military commanders and jail supervisors to keep mandatory detention 
records or follow notification procedures made accounting for all 
detainees difficult. In some cases detainees were released without a 
trial because they had already served more than one-third of the maximum
 sentence for their charges.</p>
<p>Civil society groups complained that authorities subjected some community leaders to extended pretrial detention.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for an independent judiciary, and the 
government generally respected judicial independence and impartiality. 
Much of the judicial system was overburdened and inefficient, however, 
and subornation, corruption, and intimidation of judges, prosecutors, 
and witnesses hindered judicial functioning.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Trial Procedures</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law provide for the right to a fair and 
public trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this 
right. While the government began implementing an accusatory system of 
justice in 2005, the use of delay tactics by defense lawyers to slow or 
impede proceedings, prosecutorsâ heavy caseloads, and other factors 
diminished the anticipated increased efficiencies and other benefits of 
adopting the adversarial model. Under the criminal procedure code, the 
prosecutor presents an accusation and evidence before an impartial judge
 at an oral, public trial. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and have the right to confront the 
trial evidence and witnesses against them, present their own evidence, 
and communicate with an attorney of their choice (or have one provided 
at public expense). Defendants had adequate time and facilities to 
prepare their defense. Defendants are not compelled to testify or 
confess guilt and have the right to appeal their proceedings. Although 
defendants have the right to an interpreter, the court system lacked 
interpreters for less commonly encountered languages. Crimes committed 
before 2005 are processed under the prior written inquisitorial system 
in which the prosecutor is a magistrate who investigates, determines 
evidence, and makes a finding of guilt or innocence. In those cases the 
trial consists of the presentation of evidence and finding of guilt or 
innocence to a judge for ratification or rejection.</p>
<p>In the military justice system, military judges preside over 
courts-martial. Counsel may represent the accused and call witnesses, 
but most fact finding takes place during the investigative stage. 
Military trial judges are required to issue rulings within eight days of
 a court-martial hearing. Representatives of the civilian Inspector 
Generalâs Office are required to be present at a court-martial.</p>
<p>Criminal procedure within the military justice system includes 
elements of the inquisitorial and accusatory systems. The law provides 
for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally 
enforced this right. Defendants are considered innocent until proven 
guilty and have the right to timely consultation with counsel.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-9" class="report__section-subtitle">Political Prisoners and Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>The government declared that it did not hold political 
prisoners; nevertheless, authorities held some members of human rights 
advocacy groups on charges of conspiracy, rebellion, or terrorism, which
 the groups described as government harassment against human rights 
advocates. According to INPEC, the government held 670 persons on 
charges of rebellion or of aiding and promoting insurgency. The 
government provided the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 
regular access to these prisoners.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-10" class="report__section-subtitle">Civil Judicial Procedures and Remedies</h3>

					
					<p>Citizens may sue a government agent or entity in the 
Administrative Court of Litigation for damages resulting from a human 
rights violation. Although critics complained of delays in the process, 
the court generally was considered impartial and effective. Cases 
involving violations of an individualâs human rights may be submitted 
through petitions by individuals or organizations to the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, which in turn may submit the case to the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The court may order civil 
remedies, including fair compensation to the individual injured.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-11" class="report__section-subtitle">Property Restitution</h3>

					
					<p>The 2011 Victimsâ and Land Restitution Law (Victimsâ Law) 
continued to provide a legal basis for assistance and reparations to 
victims of the conflict, including victims of government abuses, but the
 government acknowledged that the pace of restitution was slow. The 
Inspector Generalâs Office, an independent and autonomous public 
institution, assisted in 277 cases related to land reclamation, i.e., 
requests for restitution.</p>
<p>The Land Restitution Unit, a semiautonomous entity in the Ministry of
 Agriculture, is responsible for returning land to displaced victims of 
conflict. The unit reported that as of the end of 2018, it had reviewed 
276 requests for collective restitution of ethnic territories covering 
an area of 17.1 million acres, including 99,754 families, and 122,463 
individual restitution claims, of which 18,478 were awaiting final 
judicial decision.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-12" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Arbitrary or Unlawful Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits such actions, but there were allegations the 
government failed to respect these prohibitions. Government authorities 
generally need a judicial order to intercept mail or email or to monitor
 telephone conversations, including in prisons. Government intelligence 
agencies investigating terrorist organizations sometimes monitored 
telephone conversations without judicial authorization; the law bars 
evidence obtained in this manner from being used in court.</p>
<p>NGOs continued to accuse domestic intelligence or security entities of spying on lawyers and human rights defenders.</p>
<p>On July 9, the Attorney Generalâs Office arrested the former 
intelligence director of the disbanded Administrative Department of 
Security, Laude Jose Fernandez Arroyo, for illegally wiretapping the 
communications of several companies and private citizens.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-13" class="report__section-subtitle">g. Abuses in Internal Conflict</h3>

					
					<p>The government and the FARC, formerly the countryâs largest 
guerrilla insurgency group, continued to implement the 2016 peace 
accord. The FARC completed its disarmament, and former members 
reincorporated as a political party in 2017. An estimated 800 to 1,500 
FARC dissident members did not participate in the peace process from the
 outset. As of November, FARC dissident numbers had grown to 
approximately 2,500 due to new recruitment and some former combatants 
who returned to arms. Members of the FARC who did participate in the 
peace process alleged the government had not fully complied with its 
commitments to ensure the security of demobilized former combatants or 
to facilitate their reintegration, while the government alleged the FARC
 had not met its full commitments to cooperate on counternarcotics 
efforts. In August a small group of FARC dissidents called for a return 
to armed conflict, alleging the government had not lived up to its 
obligations under the peace agreement. Following the signing of the 2016
 peace accord, three transitional justice mechanisms were established 
and were operational throughout the year: The Commission for the 
Clarification of Truth, Coexistence, and Nonrepetition; the Special Unit
 for the Search for Disappeared Persons; and the JEP.</p>
<p>The ELN, a smaller leftist guerilla force of approximately 3,000 
armed combatants, continued to commit crimes and acts of terror 
throughout the country, including bombings, violence against civilian 
populations, and violent attacks against military and police facilities.
 Illegal armed groups and drug gangs, such as the Gulf Clan, also 
continued to operate. The Colombia-Europe-United States Coordination 
Group (CCEEU) and other NGOs considered some of these illegal armed 
groups to be composed of former paramilitary groups. The government 
acknowledged that some former paramilitary members were active in 
illegal armed groups but noted these groups lacked the national, unified
 command structure and explicit ideological agenda that defined past 
paramilitary groups, including the disbanded United Self-Defense Forces 
of Colombia (AUC).</p>
<p><u>Killings</u>: The military was accused of some killings, some of 
which military officials stated were âmilitary mistakesâ (see section 
1.a.). In other cases, military officials stated they believed an 
individual was fighting on behalf of an illegal armed group, while 
community members stated the victim was not a combatant. For example, 
media reported that Jose Albeiro Chaparro and Eliecer Gonzalez Chaparro 
were allegedly killed by members of Army Task Force Quiron during 
confrontations between the army and FARC dissidents in May. According to
 the army, both men were identified as FARC dissidents who were armed 
and had attacked the implicated soldiers. Community leaders disputed the
 armyâs account, saying the victims were day laborers on their way to 
work at a neighboring farm. They further alleged that the army 
manipulated the crime scene.</p>
<p>In addition, in November opposition legislators accused then minister
 of defense Guillermo Botero of withholding information regarding the 
militaryâs August 29 aerial attack on an alleged FARC dissident camp 
that killed 14 persons, including eight minors. Botero subsequently 
resigned under congressional pressure on November 6.</p>
<p>Guerrillas, notably the ELN, committed unlawful killings. On January 
17, a total of 22 persons were killed and 68 injured in a car bomb 
attack on the General Santander National Police Academy. The Attorney 
Generalâs Office identified the attacker as Jose Aldemar Rojas, an ELN 
operative, who died in the attack.</p>
<p>Illegal armed groups committed numerous political and unlawful 
killings, primarily in areas under dispute with guerrillas or without a 
strong government presence.</p>
<p>Organized-crime gangs and guerrilla groups killed, threatened, and 
displaced educators and their families for political and financial 
reasons, often because teachers represented the only government presence
 in the remote areas where the killings occurred.</p>
<p>Independent observers raised concerns that inadequate security 
guarantees were facilitating the killing of former FARC militants. 
According to the October 1 <i>Report of the Secretary-General on the UN Verification Mission in Colombia</i>,
 147 former FARC combatants had been killed since the signing of the 
2016 peace accord. According to the report, of those 147 cases, the 
Attorney Generalâs Office reported 13 cases with convictions, 13 in the 
trial stage, 27 under investigation, and 30 with pending arrest 
warrants. The United Nations also reported the government began to 
implement additional steps to strengthen security guarantees for former 
FARC combatants, including deploying additional judicial police officers
 and attorneys to prioritized departments, promoting initiatives for 
prevention of stigmatization against former combatants, and establishing
 a roadmap for the protection of political candidates, including the 
FARC party.</p>
<p><u>Abductions</u>: Organized-crime gangs, the ELN, and common 
criminals continued to kidnap persons, both for ransom and for political
 reasons. According to the Ministry of Defense, from January 1 to June 
30, there were 31 kidnappings attributed to common criminals, seven 
cases to the ELN, and three to organized armed groups. On July 18, in 
Riosucio, Choco, ELN rebels kidnapped local businessman Edwin Octavio 
Sanchez Correa. As of November the victim remained in captivity and no 
arrests had been made.</p>
<p>Between January and June, the Ministry of Defense reported 19 
hostages had been freed, two hostages died in captivity, and seven were 
released after pressure from the government.</p>
<p>The Special Unit for the Search for Disappeared Persons provided for 
in the peace accord is mandated to account for those who disappeared in 
the context of the armed conflict and, when possible, locate and return 
remains to families. According to the Observatory of Memory and 
Conflict, more than 80,000 persons were reported missing as a result of 
the armed conflict, including 1,214 military and police personnel who 
were kidnapped by the FARC and ELN.</p>
<p><u>Physical Abuse, Punishment, and Torture</u>: CINEP reported FARC 
dissidents and organized-crime gangs were responsible for six documented
 cases of torture in the first six months of 2018, the most recent data 
available.</p>
<p>The ELN, FARC dissidents, and other groups continued to lay land 
mines. According to the NGO Group of Integral Action against Land Mines,
 there were 72 victims of improvised explosive devices and land mines 
between January 1 and June 30.</p>
<p><u>Child Soldiers</u>: There were reports the ELN and other illegal 
armed groups recruited persons younger than 18. The government continued
 a program to counter recruitment of child soldiers. By yearâs end it 
had reached 500 at-risk villages, an estimated 28,250 minors, and 15,000
 families.</p>
<p><u>Other Conflict-related Abuses</u>: During the year reports of 
other human rights abuses occurred in the context of the conflict and 
narcotics trafficking. Drug traffickers, guerrilla fighters, and other 
illegal armed groups continued to displace predominantly poor and rural 
populations (see section 2.e., Internally Displaced Persons).</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for freedom of expression, including for the 
press, and the government generally respected this right. Violence and 
harassment, as well as the criminalization of libel, inhibited freedom 
of the press, and the government frequently influenced the press, in 
part through its large advertising budgets. The independent media were 
active and expressed a wide variety of views without restriction.</p>
<p><u>Violence and Harassment</u>: According to the domestic NGO 
Foundation for Press Freedom (FLIP), through August 16, there were 83 
threats against journalists and 250 incidents of violence or harassment.
 FLIP also reported that between January and August, no journalists were
 illegally detained and 21 were physically assaulted. One was ordered 
detained for failure to comply with a protective order related to a 
defamation case, but the detention order was never enforced. According 
to FLIP, there were three convictions for threats against journalists 
through September.</p>
<p>As of June 30, the NPU provided protection services to 162 
journalists. Some NGOs raised concerns about perceived shortcomings in 
the NPU, such as delays in granting protection and the appropriateness 
of measures for addressing specific threats.</p>
<p><u>Censorship or Content Restrictions</u>: FLIP alleged some 
journalists practiced self-censorship due to fear of being sued under 
libel laws or of being physically attacked, mostly by nongovernment 
actors. FLIP asserted that the high degree of impunity for those who 
committed aggressions against journalists was also a factor.</p>
<p><u>Libel/Slander Laws</u>: By law slander and libel are crimes. There
 is no specific law against slandering public officials, and the 
government did not use prosecution to prevent media outlets from 
criticizing government policies or public officials. Political 
candidates, businesspersons, and others, however, publicly threatened to
 sue journalists for expressing their opinions, alleging defamation or 
libel. FLIP reported one defamation case filed against a journalist 
during the year.</p>
<p><u>Nongovernmental Impact</u>: Members of illegal armed groups 
inhibited freedom of expression by intimidating, threatening, 
kidnapping, and killing journalists. National and international NGOs 
reported local media representatives regularly practiced self-censorship
 because of threats of violence from these groups. For example, NGOs 
reported on the June killing of Libardo Montenegro, a reporter for the 
community radio station in Samaniego, Narino. No arrests were made, but 
NGOs reported the killing might have been a response to Montenegroâs 
coverage of drug-related violence in the region. In August, five 
journalists in Valle de Cauca received threats via text message after 
reporting on power cuts to municipalities in the area. Those responsible
 for the threats were unknown.</p>

					<p>The government did not restrict or disrupt access to the 
internet or censor online content, and there were no credible reports 
that the government monitored private online communications without 
appropriate legal authority. Due to the general climate of impunity and 
violence in some areas, self-censorship occurred both online and 
offline, particularly within rural communities.</p>

					<p>The law provides for the freedom of peaceful assembly, and the 
government generally respected this right. Some NGOs alleged that riot 
police (<i>Esmad</i>) used excessive force to break up demonstrations.</p>
<p>On January 1, the National Police issued a directive to govern their 
response to demonstrations. NGOs and press reports alleged the directive
 had not been entirely effective in managing protests peacefully, citing
 the use of police force during university protests in September. Human 
rights groups and NGOs also alleged the Esmad used excessive force to 
suppress protests by indigenous groups in March and April. Indigenous 
communities joined together to hold sustained protests (known as a <i>minga</i>)
 that closed highways as they called for increased government attention 
to address violence against social leaders, implement the 2016 peace 
accord, and fulfill agreements reached with indigenous communities after
 two months of strikes in late 2018.</p>
<p>In November student groups, labor unions, and human rights activists 
engaged in mostly peaceful protests throughout the country, advocating 
for changes to the governmentâs social and economic policies. Some NGOs 
and media reports accused security forces of using excessive force after
 protests turned violent, and media outlets reported that the Attorney 
Generalâs Office opened 11 investigations involving the Esmad resulting 
from the protests in Bogota.</p>

					<p>The law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign 
travel, emigration, and repatriation. The government generally respected
 these rights, although there were exceptions. Military operations and 
insecurity in certain rural areas restricted freedom of movement.</p>
<p><u>In-country Movement</u>: The government required asylum seekers and individuals without regularized migration status to have <i>salvaconductos</i>
 (safe passage documents) to travel throughout the country. 
Organized-crime gangs, ELN guerrillas, and other illegal armed groups 
continued to establish illegal checkpoints on rural roads.</p>
<p>International and civil society organizations also reported that 
illegal armed groups confined rural communities through roadblocks, 
curfews, car bombs at egress routes, and improvised explosive devices in
 areas where illicit crop cultivation and narcotics trafficking 
persisted. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs, between January and August, more than 342,000 
persons faced mobility restrictions that limited their access to 
essential goods and services due to armed incidents and geographical 
factors.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-9" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Internally Displaced Persons</h3>

					
					<p>There were approximately 7.8 million internally displaced 
persons (IDPs) in the country, largely a result of the armed conflict. 
Threats posed by illegal armed groups drove internal displacement in 
remote areas as well as urban settings. In some areas the FARC 
withdrawal resulted in a struggle for control by other illegal armed 
groups, causing violence and internal displacement. The government, 
international organizations, and civil society groups identified various
 factors causing displacement, including threats, extortion, and 
physical, psychological, and sexual violence by illegal armed groups 
against civilian populations, particularly women and girls. Other causes
 of displacement included competition and armed confrontation among and 
within illegal armed groups for resources and territorial control; 
confrontations between security forces, guerrillas, and organized-crime 
gangs; and forced recruitment of children or threats of forced 
recruitment. Drug trafficking, illegal mining, and large-scale 
commercial ventures in rural areas also contributed to displacement. 
Local institutions lacked the capacity in many areas to protect the 
rights of, and provide public services to, IDPs and communities at risk 
of displacement, and consequently the government struggled to provide 
adequate protection or humanitarian assistance to newly displaced 
populations.</p>
<p>The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported 
that 33,400 persons were affected in 112 displacement events in 2018 and
 that 12,000 persons were affected in 37 displacement events between 
January and June 2019. Departments with the highest rate of mass 
displacements included Antioquia, Choco, Cordoba, Narino, and Norte de 
Santander.</p>
<p>The Victimsâ Unit maintained the Single Victims Registry as mandated 
by law. Despite improvements in the government registration system, IDPs
 experienced delays in receiving responses to their displacement claims 
due to a large backlog of claims built up during several months, lack of
 the unitâs presence in rural areas, and other constraints. Government 
policy provides for an appeals process in the case of refusals.</p>
<p>The ELN and organized-crime gangs continued to use force, 
intimidation, and disinformation to discourage IDPs from registering 
with the government. International organizations and civil society 
expressed concern over urban displacement caused by violence stemming 
from territorial disputes between criminal gangs, some of which had 
links to larger criminal and narcotrafficking groups.</p>
<p>The Victimsâ Unit cited extortion, forced recruitment by illegal 
armed groups, killings, and physical and sexual violence as the primary 
causes of intraurban displacement. The Office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that in some departments 
displacement disproportionately affected indigenous and Afro-Colombian 
groups.</p>
<p>As of June the government registered 212,081 IDPs who identified as 
indigenous, and 834,597 who identified as Afro-Colombian. Indigenous 
persons constituted approximately 3 percent and Afro-Colombians 
approximately 11 percent of new IDPs registered by the government.</p>
<p>The NGO National Association of Displaced Afrodescendants (AFRODES) 
stated that threats and violence against Afro-Colombian leaders and 
communities continued to cause high levels of forced displacement, 
especially in the Pacific Coast region. AFRODES and other local NGOs 
expressed concern that large-scale economic projects, such as 
agriculture and mining, contributed to displacement in their 
communities.</p>
<p>By law, 52 government agencies are responsible for assisting 
registered IDPs. In addition, dozens of international organizations; 
international NGOs; domestic nonprofit groups; and multilateral 
organizations, including the International Organization for Migration, 
World Food Program, ICRC, UNHCR, and Colombian Red Cross, coordinated 
with the government to provide emergency relief and long-term assistance
 to displaced populations.</p>
<p>International organizations and NGOs remained concerned about the 
slow and insufficient institutional response to displacement. As a 
result, NGOs took responsibility for providing humanitarian assistance 
to recently displaced individuals. International organizations and civil
 society reported that a lack of local capacity to accept registrations 
in high-displacement areas often delayed assistance to persons displaced
 individually or in smaller groups. Humanitarian organizations 
attributed the delays to a variety of factors, including the lack of 
personnel, funding, declaration forms, and training. Insecurity in 
communities affected by the conflict, including areas in the departments
 of Antioquia, Cauca, Choco, Narino, and Norte de Santander, sometimes 
delayed national and international aid organizations from reaching newly
 displaced populations.</p>
<p>Despite several government initiatives to enhance IDP access to 
services and awareness of their rights, municipalities in many parts of 
the country did not have the resources or capacity to respond to new 
displacements and provide humanitarian assistance to IDPs. Many IDPs 
continued to live in poverty in unhygienic conditions and with limited 
access to health care, education, shelter, and employment.</p>
<p>Displaced persons also sought protection across international 
borders. UNHCR estimated that Colombia was the country of origin for 
400,000 refugees and persons in a refugee-like situation, the majority 
in Ecuador, with additional populations in neighboring countries, 
including Costa Rica and Panama. The governments of Colombia and Ecuador
 continued to meet throughout the year regarding the situation of 
Colombian refugees and asylum seekers in Ecuador, and the Colombian 
government offered a program to assist Colombians abroad who returned to
 Colombia. In addition, the government estimated that 500,000 
Colombians, many of whom were displaced by the conflict in Colombia and 
registered as refugees in Venezuela, had returned from Venezuela as of 
August.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-10" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Protection of Refugees</h3>

					
					<p><u>Access to Asylum</u>: The law provides for the granting of 
asylum or refugee status, and the government has established a system 
for providing protection to refugees. The government reported it had 
approved 86 requests for recognition of refugee status of the 6,451 
applications it received from 2016 to July 23, 2019. Venezuelans 
represented approximately 95 percent of applications during the year. 
Authorities stated the asylum process took at least one year, during 
which applicants were given a permit to stay in the country but were not
 allowed to work. In October the government opened an asylum office in 
Bogota to increase its capacity to process a backlog of more than 5,000 
cases.</p>
<p>During the year there was a large increase in migration flows from 
Venezuela. According to migration officials, as of November the country 
hosted more than 1.5 million Venezuelans. While the government generally
 provided access to the asylum process for persons who requested 
international protection, many opted for alternative migration status. 
In August the government issued an administrative resolution granting 
Colombian citizenship to Venezuelan children born in Colombia on or 
after August 19, 2015, immediately granting citizenship to 24,000 
children.</p>
<p><u>Temporary Protection</u>: The government also provided temporary 
residence permits (PEPs) to Venezuelans who met certain eligibility 
requirements. Approximately 600,000 Venezuelans who entered with 
passports legally were granted PEPs in 2017-18, according to migration 
officials. PEPs provide access to work, primary and secondary education,
 and the social insurance system as well as the ability to open bank 
accounts. The temporary residency permit is valid for up to two years. 
In August the government announced a two-year extension for PEPs issued 
in 2017.</p>
<p>According to UNHCR, there were more than nine million persons of 
concern (including refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs, returned IDPs, 
returned refugees, stateless persons, and others of concern) residing in
 the country in 2018, compared with 7.7 million in 2017.</p>

					<p>The law provides citizens the ability to choose their government
 through free and fair periodic elections held by secret ballot and 
based on nearly universal suffrage. Active-duty members of the armed 
forces and police may neither vote nor participate in the political 
process. Civilian public employees are eligible to vote, although they 
may participate in partisan politics only during the four months 
immediately preceding a national election.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-3__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Elections and Political Participation</h3>

					
					<p><u>Recent Elections</u>: Legislative and presidential elections 
were held in March and May 2018, respectively. Because no presidential 
candidate won more than 50 percent of the vote in the election, as 
required for a victory in the first round, in June a second election was
 held, in which voters elected Ivan Duque Marquez president. Observers 
considered the elections free and fair and the most peaceful in decades.
 There were no reports of election-related violence during the June 2018
 presidential runoff, in which the candidate of the Democratic Center 
party, Ivan Duque, defeated the candidate of Humane Colombia, Gustavo 
Petro. The then minister of defense, Luis Carlos Villegas, described it 
as the most peaceful election in decades. The leading domestic elections
 NGO, Electoral Observation Mission, deployed 3,524 nonpartisan 
volunteers to monitor the elections. International observers included an
 electoral observation mission of the Organization of American States. 
The first local and regional elections since the signing of the peace 
accord took place on October 27 and were largely peaceful. Observers 
reported some indications of electoral fraud, including vote buying.</p>
<p><u>Political Parties and Political Participation</u>: Organized-crime
 gangs and the ELN threatened and killed government officials (see 
section 1.g.). As of May 31, the NPU, under the Ministry of Interior, 
was providing protection to 387 mayors, 17 governors, and 1,674 other 
persons, including members of departmental assemblies, council members, 
judges, municipal human rights officers, and other officials related to 
national human rights policies. By decree the CNPâs protection program 
and the NPU assume shared responsibility for protecting municipal and 
district mayors.</p>
<p>As part of the peace accord, the FARC registered a political party in
 2017 under the name Peopleâs Alternative Revolutionary Force, 
maintaining the same acronym. The accord guaranteed the FARC political 
party 10 seats in Congressâfive each in the Senate and in the House of 
Representativesâin the 2018 and 2022 elections.</p>
<p><u>Participation of Women and Minorities</u>: No laws limit the 
participation of women or members of minorities in the political 
process, and they did participate. The share of female officials in the 
cabinet was more than 50 percent.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for official corruption, and
 the government generally implemented these laws effectively, although 
officials sometimes engaged in corrupt practices without punishment. The
 World Bankâs worldwide governance indicators reflected that government 
corruption was a serious problem. Revenues from transnational organized 
crime, including drug trafficking, exacerbated corruption.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: Through September the Attorney Generalâs Office 
registered 31,239 allegations related to corruption and had formally 
begun investigating 4,014. In September authorities sentenced Aida 
Merlano to 15 years in prison for buying votes to win a seat in the 
March 2018 election for seats in Congress. The first politician to be 
jailed for buying votes, Merlano escaped police custody on October 1 and
 remained at large as of November.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: By law public officials must file annual
 financial disclosure forms with the tax authority. The information is 
not made public. The law states that persons who intend to hold public 
office or work as contractors for the government for more than three 
months shall submit a statement of assets and income as well as 
information on their private economic activity. The human resources 
chief in each entity is responsible for verifying the information 
submitted. Congress maintained a website on which members could 
voluntarily post their financial information.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A wide variety of domestic and international human rights groups
 generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
were typically cooperative and willing to listen to local human rights 
groupsâ concerns.</p>
<p>Several NGOs reported receiving threats in the form of email, mail, 
telephone calls, false obituaries, and objects related to death, such as
 coffins and funeral bouquets. The government condemned the threats and 
called on the Attorney Generalâs Office to investigate them. Some 
activists claimed the government did not take the threats seriously.</p>
<p>The government announced advances in the investigations into attacks 
and killings of human rights defenders and assigned priority resources 
to these cases.</p>
<p>Through July the Attorney Generalâs Office reported 753 active 
investigations into threats against human rights defenders. There were 
three convictions in cases of threats against human rights defenders 
during the year.</p>
<p>As of May 31, the NPUâs protection program provided protection to a 
total of 7,313 individuals. Among the NPUâs protected persons were 4,519
 human rights activists.</p>
<p>To help monitor and verify that human rights were respected 
throughout implementation of the peace accord, the government formally 
renewed the mandate of the OHCHR in October for a period of three years.
 The accord requests that the OHCHR include a âspecial chapter on 
implementation of the agreements from the standpoint of human rightsâ in
 its annual reports.</p>
<p><u>Government Human Rights Bodies</u>: The ombudsman is independent, 
submits an annual report to the House of Representatives, and has 
responsibility for providing for the promotion and exercise of human 
rights. According to human rights groups, underfunding of the 
Ombudsmanâs Office limited its ability to monitor violations 
effectively. The ombudsman, as well as members of his regional offices, 
reported threats from illegal armed groups issued through pamphlets, 
email, and violent actions.</p>
<p>The National System for Human Rights and International Humanitarian 
Lawâled by a commission of 18 senior government officials, including the
 vice presidentâdesigns, implements, and evaluates the governmentâs 
policies on human rights and international humanitarian law. The Office 
of the Presidential Advisor for Human Rights coordinates national human 
rights policy and actions taken by government entities to promote or 
protect human rights.</p>
<p>Both the Senate and House of Representatives have human rights 
committees that served as forums for discussion of human rights

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">Women</h3>

					
					<p><u>Rape and Domestic Violence</u>: Although prohibited by law, 
rape of men or women, including spousal rape, remained a serious 
problem. The law provides for sentences ranging from eight to 30 yearsâ 
imprisonment for violent sexual assault. For acts of spousal sexual 
violence, the law mandates prison sentences of six months to two years. 
By law femicide is punishable with penalties of 21 to 50 years in 
prison, longer than the minimum sentence of 13 years for homicide.</p>
<p>Violence against women, as well as impunity for perpetrators, 
continued to be a problem. Members of illegal armed groups, including 
former paramilitary members and guerrillas, also continued to rape and 
abuse women and children sexually.</p>
<p>The government continued to employ the Elite Sexual Assault 
Investigative Unit interagency unit in Bogota, which was dedicated to 
the investigation of sexual assault cases. From January to August, the 
Attorney Generalâs Office opened 26,968 new investigations for sexual 
crimes, compared with 28,942 in 2018.</p>
<p>The law requires the government to provide victims of domestic 
violence immediate protection from further physical or psychological 
abuse.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense continued implementing its protocol for 
managing cases of sexual violence and harassment involving members of 
the military. The district secretary of women, in Bogota, and the 
Ombudsmanâs Office offered free legal aid for victims of gender violence
 and organized courses to teach officials how to treat survivors of 
gender violence respectfully.</p>
<p>The law augments both imprisonment and fines if a crime causes 
âtransitory or permanent physical disfigurement,â such as acid attacks, 
which have a penalty of up to 50 years in prison.</p>
<p><u>Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C)</u>: The law prohibits 
FGM/C, but isolated incidents were reported in several indigenous 
communities in different parts of the country. Two-thirds of women from 
the Embera community had undergone FGM/C, according to the UN Population
 Fund.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Harassment</u>: The law provides measures to deter and 
punish harassment in the workplace, such as sexual harassment, verbal 
abuse or derision, aggression, and discrimination, which carries a 
penalty of one to three yearsâ imprisonment. Nonetheless, NGOs reported 
sexual harassment remained a pervasive and underreported problem in 
workplaces and in public.</p>
<p><u>Coercion in Population Control</u>: Coerced abortion is not 
permitted under the law. The law allows the involuntary surgical 
sterilization of children with cognitive and psychosocial disabilities 
in certain cases.</p>
<p>Through August 18, the Attorney Generalâs Office reported opening 18 investigations related to cases of forced abortion.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: Although women have the same legal rights as 
men, discrimination against women persisted. The Office of the Advisor 
for the Equality of Women has primary responsibility for combating 
discrimination against women, but advocacy groups reported that the 
office remained seriously underfunded. The government continued its 
national public policy for gender equity.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Children</h3>

					
					<p><u>Birth Registration</u>: Citizenship is derived by birth 
within the countryâs territory in most cases. Most births were 
registered immediately. If a birth is not registered within one month, 
parents may be fined and denied public services.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: Child abuse was a serious problem. The Attorney 
Generalâs Office reported that 53 percent of its nearly 27,000 
investigations into sexual crimes through July 31 involved a minor 
younger than 14. The Colombian Family Welfare Institute (ICBF) reported 
that between January and July 31, there were 6,150 cases of sexual abuse
 against children.</p>
<p><u>Early and Forced Marriage</u>: Marriage is legal at the age of 18.
 Boys older than 14 and girls older than 12 may marry with the consent 
of their parents. According to UNICEF, 5 percent of girls were married 
before age 15 and 23 percent before age 18.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: Sexual exploitation of 
children remained a problem. The law prohibits sexual exploitation of a 
minor or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a minor and stipulates a
 penalty of 14 to 25 years in prison, with aggravated penalties for 
perpetrators who are family members of the victim and for cases of 
sexual tourism, forced marriage, or sexual exploitation by illegal armed
 groups. The law prohibits pornography using children younger than 18 
and stipulates a penalty of 10 to 20 years in prison and a fine for 
violations. The minimum age for consensual sex is 14. The penalty for 
sexual activity with a child younger than 14 ranges from nine to 13 
years in prison. The government generally enforced the law.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office reported opening 796 investigations 
related to cases of child pornography and sentenced 24 perpetrators. In 
September, Liliana Campo Puello, whom authorities charged with running 
an extensive child trafficking ring for the purposes of sexual 
exploitation, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight years in prison.
 Her father, Carlos Enrique Campo Caballero, was also convicted and 
sentenced to 56 monthsâ imprisonment. The judge in the case accused 
Puello of continuing to operate the trafficking ring while imprisoned. 
In 2018 authorities in Cartagena arrested Puello as part of a three-day 
operation, during which they arrested 18 persons and charged them with 
the sexual exploitation of more than 250 women and girls. Prosecutors 
alleged that some of the women and girls were tattooed and trafficked 
for purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. Media reported 
authorities conducted several raids to dismantle networks of sexual 
exploitation of minors in Cartagena and other cities in 2018. In total, 
42 persons were captured, and goods valued at 154 billion Colombian 
pesos ($49 million) were seized. Commercial sexual exploitation of 
children in mining areas remained widespread.</p>
<p><u>Displaced Children</u>: The NGO Consultancy for Human Rights and 
Displacement estimated in 2016 that 31 percent of persons registered as 
displaced since 1985 were minors at the time they were displaced (see 
also section 2.e.).</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is a party to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs <i>Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction</i> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200513134357/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data/reported-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://

					<p>The law punishes those who arbitrarily restrict the full 
exercise of the rights of persons with disabilities or harass persons 
with disabilities, but enforcement was rare. The law prohibits 
discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities but
 does not explicitly prohibit discrimination against persons with 
sensory or intellectual disabilities. No law mandates access to 
information and telecommunications for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>The Office of the Presidential Advisor for Human Rights under the 
high counselor for postconflict, public security, and human rights, 
along with the Human Rights Directorate at the Ministry of Interior, is 
responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities. 
According to Somos Defensores and other NGOs, the law was seldom 
enforced.</p>
<p>Although children with disabilities attended school at all levels, 
advocates noted the vast majority of teachers and schools were neither 
trained nor equipped to educate children with disabilities successfully.
 Advocacy groups also stated children with disabilities entered the 
education system later than children without disabilities and dropped 
out at higher rates. Persons with disabilities were unemployed at a much
 higher rate than the general population.</p>
<p>In 2013 the State Council ordered all public offices to make 
facilities accessible to persons with disabilities and asked public 
officials to include requirements for accessibility when granting 
licenses for construction and occupancy. The State Council also asked 
every municipality to enforce rules that would make all public offices 
accessible to persons with disabilities âin a short amount of time.â It 
was not clear if much progress had been made.</p>

					<p>According to the 2018 national census, approximately 9.3 percent
 of the countryâs population described themselves as being of African 
descent. A 2011 UN report estimated Afro-Colombians made up 15 to 20 
percent of the population, while human rights groups and Afro-Colombian 
organizations estimated the proportion to be 20 to 25 percent.</p>
<p>Afro-Colombians are entitled to all constitutional rights and 
protections, but they faced significant economic and social 
discrimination. According to a 2016 UN report, 32 percent of the 
countryâs population lived below the poverty line, but in Choco, the 
department with the highest percentage of Afro-Colombian residents, 79 
percent of residents lived below the poverty line.</p>
<p>In 2010 the government approved a policy to promote equal opportunity
 for black, Afro-Colombian, Palenquera, and Raizal populations. 
(Palenquera populations inhabit some parts of the Caribbean coast, 
Raizal populations live in the San Andres archipelago, and Blacks and 
Afro-Colombians are Colombians of African descent who self-identify 
slightly differently based on their unique linguistic and cultural 
heritages.) The Ministry of Interior provided technical advice and 
funding for social projects presented by Afro-Colombian communities.</p>
<p>The National Autonomous Congress of Afro-Colombian Community Councils
 and Ethnic Organizations for Blacks, Afro-Colombians, Raizals, and 
Palenqueras, consisting of 108 representatives, met with government 
representatives on problems that affected their communities.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">Indigenous People</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law give special recognition to the 
fundamental rights of indigenous persons, who make up approximately 3.4 
percent of the population, and require the government to consult 
beforehand with indigenous groups regarding governmental actions that 
could affect them.</p>
<p>The law accords indigenous groups perpetual rights to their ancestral
 lands, but indigenous groups, neighboring landowners, and the 
government often disputed the demarcation of those lands. Traditional 
indigenous groups operated 710 reservations, accounting for 
approximately 28 percent of the countryâs territory. Illegal armed 
groups often violently contested indigenous land ownership and recruited
 indigenous children to join their ranks.</p>
<p>The law provides for special criminal and civil jurisdictions within 
indigenous territories based on traditional community laws. Legal 
proceedings in these jurisdictions were subject to manipulation and 
often rendered punishments more lenient than those imposed by civilian 
state courts.</p>
<p>Some indigenous groups continued to assert they were not able to 
participate adequately in decisions affecting their lands. The 
constitution provides for a âprior consultationâ mechanism for 
indigenous communities, but it does not require the government to obtain
 the consent of those communities in all cases. Indigenous communities 
joined together to hold weeks-long protests known as the âMinga for 
Defending Life, Territory, Democracy, Justice, and Peaceâ that closed 
highways as they called for increased government attention to systemic 
violence facing indigenous communities.</p>
<p>The government stated that for security reasons, it could not provide
 advance notice of most military operations, especially when in pursuit 
of enemy combatants, and added that it consulted with indigenous leaders
 when possible before entering land held by their communities.</p>
<p>Despite special legal protections and government assistance programs,
 indigenous persons continued to suffer discrimination and often lived 
on the margins of society. They belonged to the countryâs poorest 
population and had the highest age-specific mortality rates.</p>
<p>Killings of members and leaders of indigenous groups remained a 
problem. According to the NGO National Indigenous Organization of 
Colombia, since the signing of the peace accord, 177 indigenous persons 
had been killed. For example, on June 23, the press reported the killing
 of Carlos Biscue, an indigenous leader on the Huellas Indigenous 
Reservation in Caloto, Cauca. Biscue, an agricultural producer and 
community organizer, was shot by armed intruders during a party in his 
honor. On October 29, FARC dissidents allegedly involved in 
narcotrafficking killed five members of the Nasa indigenous community, 
including the indigenous reserve governor and spiritual leader, in La 
Luz village in the semiautonomous municipality of Taceuyo, Cauca. On the
 following day, the government announced the deployment of 2,500 troops 
to the area to reinforce security, restore order, and capture those 
responsible. President Duque also announced plans to accelerate 
implementation of the <i>Cauca Social Plan</i>, a program to create 
greater socioeconomic opportunities for the inhabitants of Cauca through
 interventions in the areas of education, entrepreneurship, 
infrastructure, and rural development.</p>
<p>Despite precautionary measures ordered by the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, ethnic Wayuu children continued to die of 
malnutrition. The United Nations and the government reported an increase
 in binational Wayuu families, including children, arriving in Colombia 
due to deteriorating conditions in Venezuela. The National Indigenous 
Organization of Colombia reported that a series of threats and armed 
confrontations led to the displacement of indigenous persons from the 
Jurado municipality. According to the indigenous organization, more than
 1,500 Embera Katio, Jumara Carra, Wounaan, and Embera persons had been 
displaced to Santa Terecita and Dos Bocas.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports of official discrimination based on sexual
 orientation in employment, housing, statelessness, or access to 
education or health care. The Ministry of Interior issued a public 
policy framework to guarantee the effective exercise of the rights of 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons. The 
framework has three pillars: protection of civil and political rights; 
promotion of democratic participation; and the right to health care, 
education, work, housing, recreation, sport, and culture.</p>
<p>Despite government measures to increase the rights and protection of 
LGBTI persons, there were reports of societal abuse and discrimination 
as well as sexual assault. NGOs claimed transgender individuals, 
particularly transgender men, were often sexually assaulted in so-called
 corrective rape. In 2017 (the most recent data available), the 
Ombudsmanâs Office reported 155 cases of abuse against LGBTI persons: 60
 percent of these involved psychological abuse, 27 percent physical 
violence, 11 percent economic discrimination, and 2 percent sexual 
violence. NGOs claimed that 109 LGBTI individuals were killed in 2017, 
with most victims being gay men or transgender women. In August, LGBTI 
activist and teacher Ariel Lopez was killed by armed intruders in his 
home in Barranquilla. Lopez had coordinated programs aimed at supporting
 implementation of the 2016 peace accord and strengthening and 
protecting LGBTI rights.</p>
<p>Transgender individuals cited barriers to public services when 
health-care providers or police officers refused to accept their 
government-issued identification. Some transgender individuals stated 
that it was difficult to change their gender designation on national 
identity documents and that transgender individuals whose identity cards
 listed them as male were required to show proof they had performed 
mandatory military service or obtained the necessary waivers from that 
service.</p>
<p>Established in 2013, the National Bureau of Urgent Cases (BNCU) is an
 interagency group that deals with cases of violence and discrimination 
against LGBTI persons. It comprises the Ombudsmanâs Office, the Office 
of the Attorney General, the National Police, the Office of the 
Presidential Advisor for Human Rights, the NPU, and the Ministry of 
Interior. The BNCU continued to hold meetings with local authorities and
 civil society concerning the proper implementation of protections for 
LGBTI persons and maintained a list of urgent cases requiring further 
investigation by national authorities. During the year the BNCU defended
 the rights of LGBTI persons to display public affection and to enjoy 
public spaces without fear of prosecution from local authorities.</p>
<p>In its most recent demographic and health survey (2015), the 
government reported that 67 percent of women and 59 percent of men 
surveyed approved the recognition of legal rights for same-sex couples, 
although only 30 percent of women and 26 percent of men approved of 
adoption by such couples, reflecting low to moderate levels of social 
acceptance throughout the country.</p>

discrimination against persons with HIV/AIDS. In its most recent 
demographic and health survey (2015), the government reported the 
responses of 78 percent of those surveyed indicated discriminatory 
attitudes towards persons with HIV/AIDS, reflecting low levels of social
 acceptance throughout the country.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the right of workers to form and join 
unions, bargain collectively, and conduct legal strikes, and it 
prohibits antiunion discrimination. Members of associated workersâ 
cooperatives are not allowed to form unions, since the law recognizes 
members of a cooperative as owners. The law prohibits members of the 
armed forces and police from forming or joining unions. The law provides
 for automatic recognition of unions that obtain 25 signatures from 
potential members and that comply with a registration process. 
Public-sector employees have the right to bargain collectively. The 
government and employers generally respected freedom of association and 
collective bargaining in practice.</p>
<p>The law permits associated workersâ cooperatives (CTAs), collective 
pacts, and union contracts. Under collective pacts, employers may 
negotiate accords on pay and labor conditions with workers in workplaces
 where no union is present or where a union represents less than 
one-third of employees. Law and regulations prohibit the use of CTAs and
 collective pacts to undermine the right to organize and bargain 
collectively, including by extending better conditions to nonunion 
workers through such pacts. Through a union contract, a company may 
contract a union, at times formed explicitly for this purpose, for a 
specific job or work; the union then in essence serves as an employer 
for its members. Workers who belong to a union that has a union contract
 with a company do not have a direct employment relationship with either
 the company or the union. Labor disputes for workers under a union 
contract may be decided through an arbitration panel versus labor courts
 if both parties agree.</p>
<p>The law does not permit members of the armed forces, police, and 
persons performing âessential public servicesâ to strike. Before 
conducting a strike, unions must follow prescribed legal procedures, 
including entering into a conversation period with the employer, 
presenting a list of demands, and gaining majority approval in the union
 for a strike. The law limits strikes to periods of contract 
negotiations or collective bargaining and allows employers to fire trade
 unionists who participate in strikes or work stoppages ruled illegal by
 the courts.</p>
<p>Government enforcement of applicable laws was inconsistent. Despite 
significant steps by the Ministry of Labor to strengthen its labor law 
inspection system, the government did not provide sufficient staffing or
 resources or establish a consistent national strategy to protect the 
rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining. The 
government did not have in place a system to ensure timely and regular 
collection of fines related to these protections and structural 
challenges adversely affected prosecutions, which resulted in a 
continued high rate of impunity for violators of these rights, including
 in cases of threats and violence against unionists.</p>
<p>The government has the authority to fine labor-rights violators. The 
penalties under the law would be sufficient to deter violations but were
 not levied consistently. The law also stipulates that offenders 
repeatedly misusing CTAs or other labor relationships shall receive the 
maximum penalty and may be subject to losing their legal status to 
operate. Employers who engage in antiunion practices may also be 
imprisoned for up to five years, although government officials admitted a
 fine was more likely than imprisonment. Prohibited practices include 
impeding workersâ right to strike, meet, or otherwise associate and 
extending better conditions to members of collective pacts than to union
 members.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Laborâs Special Investigations Unit, which is part of
 the labor inspectorate and overseen by the vice minister for labor 
relations and inspections, continued to exercise its power to 
investigate and impose sanctions in any jurisdiction. The vice minister 
for labor relations decides on a case-by-case basis whether to assign 
the Special Investigations Unit or the regional inspectors to 
investigate certain sites or review particular cases. The unit was 
reportedly overburdened with cases, resulting in denials of recent union
 requests for review by the unit.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor leads a tripartite Interinstitutional 
Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Human Rights of 
Workers, with participation by the government, organized labor groups, 
and the business community. As of June the commission met two times 
during the year in Bogota.</p>
<p>As part of its commitments under the 2011 <i>Colombian Action Plan Related to Labor Rights</i> (<i>Labor Action Plan</i>),
 the government continued to take steps to protect internationally 
recognized labor rights. Labor inspections by the Ministry of Labor for 
abusive subcontracting in the five priority sectors of palm oil, sugar, 
ports, mines, and cut flowers remained infrequent, however. Critics 
claimed inspections lacked necessary rigor, assessed fines were not 
collected, and abusive subcontracting continued. In the first six months
 of the year, there were no new fines assessed for illegal labor 
intermediation or for violations of freedom of association in any of the
 five priority sectors. During this time there were also no fines 
collected in any of the five priority sectors for such violations, 
although four fines for violations from previous years were finalized 
for future collection. The government continued to engage in regular 
meetings with unions and civil society groups.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor, in collaboration with the International Labor 
Organization (ILO), continued to train labor inspectors through a 
virtual training campus to prepare labor inspectors to identify 
antiunion conduct, among other violations. It also implemented methods, 
including contract and process maps, as strategic planning tools to 
prioritize interventions. The ministry continued to employ a telephone- 
and internet-based complaint mechanism to report alleged labor 
violations. Union members complained that the systems did not allow 
citizens to register anonymous complaints and noted that complaints 
registered through the telephone and internet systems did not result in 
action.</p>
<p>Judicial police, the Technical Investigation Body, and prosecutors 
investigating criminal cases of threats and killings are required to 
determine during the initial phase of an investigation whether a victim 
is an active or retired union member or is actively engaged in union 
formation and organization, but it was unclear whether they did so. It 
could take several months to transfer cases from regional field offices 
of the Attorney Generalâs Office to the Attorney Generalâs Human Rights 
Directorate, and cases are transferred only with the approval of the 
attorney general in response to direct requests, instead of 
automatically.</p>
<p>The government continued to include in its protection program for 
labor activists persons engaged in efforts to form a union as well as 
former unionists under threat because of their past activities. As of 
May the NPU was providing protection to 306 trade union leaders or 
members. Approximately 6 percent of the NPUâs budget was dedicated to 
unionist protection as of April. Between January 1 and July, the NPU 
processed 185 risk assessments of union leaders or members; 108 of those
 individuals were assessed as facing an âextraordinary threat,â and the 
NPU provided them protection measures. The NPU reported that during the 
year the average time needed to implement protection measures upon 
completion of a risk analysis was 60 days in regular cases or five days 
for emergency cases. NGOs, however, complained about slow processing 
times.</p>
<p>The protection and relocation of teachers falls under the Ministry of
 National Education and the departmental education secretaries, but the 
NPU retains some responsibilities for the risk analysis and protection 
of family members. Through July 31, the NPU evaluated 78 threat cases 
against teachers and found 50 to be facing extraordinary risk.</p>
<p>In cases of unionist killings from previous years, the pace of 
investigations and convictions remained slow, and high rates of impunity
 continued, although progress was made in the rate of case resolution. 
The Attorney Generalâs Office reported receiving 205 cases of homicides 
of unionists between January 2011 and June 2019. Whereas between January
 2011 and August 2016, 20 sentences for homicides were issued, between 
September 2016 and June 2019âfollowing the creation of an âelite groupâ 
and implementation of a strategy to prioritize cases of homicides 
against unionistsâ29 sentences were issued. Labor groups stated more 
needed to be done to address impunity for perpetrators of violence 
against trade unionists and the large number of threat cases.</p>
<p>Violence, threats, harassment, and other practices against trade 
unionists continued to affect the exercise of the right to freedom of 
association and collective bargaining. According to the Attorney 
Generalâs Office, through September 19, one teacher was registered as a 
victim in cases of homicide.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office reported the killing of 27 trade 
unionists between January 2018 and June 2019. There was progress in the 
investigation and prosecution of several of these cases, with persons 
implicated in three of the cases receiving a sentence, five cases in 
which trials were continuing, and three cases in which charges had been 
filed. The National Union School (ENS), a labor rights NGO and think 
tank, reported 11 trade unionists were killed through August. The ENS 
and other labor groups stated that focusing on killings alone masked the
 true nature and scope of the violence against labor activists. Labor 
groups noted that in some regions, nonlethal violations continued to 
increase. The ENS reported 136 death threats, six nonlethal attacks, two
 cases of forced displacement, four cases of harassment, and one illegal
 raid.</p>
<p>Unions cited multiple instances in which companies fired employees 
who formed or sought to form new unions. Some employers continued to use
 temporary contracts, service agencies, and other forms of 
subcontracting, including cooperatives, to limit worker rights and 
protections. Fines assessed by the government did little to dissuade 
violators because fines were often not collected. The government 
continued to reach formalization agreements with firms engaged in 
abusive subcontracting or that had labor conflict during the year. In 
the first six months of the year, the government reported 480 workers 
benefited from 15 formalization agreements that the Ministry of Labor 
reached with employers in key sectors, including manufacturing, health, 
transport, and hospitality. During this time, however, there were no 
formalization agreements reached in any of the five priority sectors. 
Labor rights groups expressed concern that previously signed 
formalization agreements were not sufficiently monitored by the 
ministry.</p>
<p>Labor confederations and NGOs reported that business owners in 
several sectors used âsimplified stock corporationsâ (SAS), union 
contracts, foundations, or temporary service agencies in attempts to 
circumvent legal restrictions on cooperatives. While in theory SAS 
workers may exercise their right to organize and bargain collectively 
with SAS management, it appeared that in some cases the SAS had little 
or no control over the conditions of employment. The Ministry of Labor 
stated that an SAS, like any corporate structure, may be fined for labor
 violations. Labor confederations and NGOs reported these enforcement 
actions did not address the scope of abusive subcontracting and illegal 
labor intermediation in the country.</p>
<p>The port workersâ labor union reported Buenaventura port operators 
engaged in abusive subcontracting through SAS and that Ministry of Labor
 inspections and adjudication of cases at the Buenaventura port were 
ineffective in safeguarding the rights to freedom of association and 
collective bargaining.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor. The 
government did not effectively enforce the law in all cases, and there 
continued to be reports that such practices occurred. The law prescribes
 punishments sufficient to deter violations. The ILO noted the law 
permits military conscripts to be compelled to undertake work beyond 
that of a military nature, such as activities designed to protect the 
environment or natural resources.</p>
<p>There were reports ELN guerrillas and organized-crime gangs used 
forced labor, including forced child labor, in coca cultivation and 
illegal mining in areas outside government control as well as forced 
criminality, such as extortion, in urban areas. The ICBF indicated that 
between November 16, 1999, and July 31, 2019, the number of children and
 adolescents who had demobilized from illegal armed groups was 6,700, of
 whom 11 percent were indigenous and 8 percent Afro-Colombian.</p>
<p>Forced labor in other sectors, including organized begging, mining, 
agriculture (especially near the coffee belt), cattle herding, crop 
harvesting, forced recruitment by illegal armed actors, and domestic 
service, remained a serious problem. Afro-Colombians, indigenous 
persons, and inhabitants of marginalized urban areas were at the highest
 risk of forced labor, domestic servitude, forced begging, and forced 
recruitment. The government did not effectively enforce the law, and the
 Ministry of Labor did not report having a protocol to connect labor 
inspectors with police in cases of forced labor.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law sets the minimum age for employment at 15 and for 
hazardous work at 18. Children 15 and 16 years of age may work no more 
than 30 hours per week, and children age 17 may work no more than 40 
hours per week. Children younger than 15 may work in arts, sports, or 
recreational or cultural activities for a maximum of 14 hours per week. 
In all these cases, working children and adolescents must have signed 
documentation filed by their parents and be approved by a labor 
inspector or other local authority.</p>
<p>The law prohibits child workers from working at night or where there 
is a risk of bodily harm or exposure to excessive heat, cold, or noise. 
The law authorizes inspectors to issue fines that would be sufficient to
 deter violations, but the government did not enforce the law 
effectively in all cases. A violation deemed to endanger a childâs life 
or threaten moral values may be punished by temporary or permanent 
closure of the establishment. Nationwide, labor inspectors are 
responsible for enforcing child labor laws and supervising the formal 
sector through periodic inspections. An estimated 80 percent of all 
child labor, however, occurred in the informal sector of the economy. 
The number of labor inspectors was insufficient to enforce the law 
effectively.</p>
<p>Government agencies carried out several activities to eradicate and 
prevent exploitative child labor. The Ministry of Labor conducted 1,142 
worksite inspections from July 2018 through June 2019 to ensure that 
adolescent workers were employed with proper authorization and received 
proper protections. Seven authorizations were revoked as a result of 
these inspections. With ILO assistance the government continued to 
improve cooperation among national, regional, and municipal governments 
on child labor problems. It also continued to employ a monitoring system
 to register working children, although the system was not always 
regularly updated. The government also sought to reduce demand for child
 labor through public awareness and training efforts, often working with
 international and civil society organizations.</p>
<p>The government, through the Ministry of Labor, followed the <i>National </i><i>Policy</i><i> to Prevent and </i><i>Eliminate Child Labor and Protect the Young Worker</i>,
 updated for the period 2019-29. It also continued its roundtable 
discussion group, which included government representatives, members of 
the three largest labor confederations, and civil society. The group 
concentrated its efforts on formalizing an integrated registration 
system for information on child labor that would permit public and 
private entities to register information about child workers.</p>
<p>The government, including through a cooperative agreement between the
 Ministry of Mines and Energy and the ICBF, continued to combat illegal 
mining and formalize artisanal mining production, with goals including 
the elimination of child labor and forced labor. Regional ICBF offices 
led efforts to combat child labor in mining at the local level, working 
with the Ministry of Labor and other government agencies to coordinate 
responses. The Department for Social Prosperity continued to implement 
the More Families in Action program to combat poverty through 
conditional cash transfers, which included a specific focus on 
addressing child labor. In interagency child labor meetings, the 
Ministry of Labor reported that whichever government presence was 
available in the areaâwhether police, the ICBF, teachers, or the 
Administrative Department for Social Prosperityâattended to children 
found working in illegal mining operations. While all agencies had 
directives on how to handle and report child labor cases, it was unclear
 whether all cases were referred to the ICBF.</p>
<p>The ICBF continued to implement several initiatives aimed at 
preventing child labor, including producing an extensive section of its 
website designed specifically for young audiences to educate children on
 child labor, their rights, and how to report child labor. The Ministry 
of Labor continued its work with the Network against Child Labor in 
which the ministry operated alongside member businesses that pledged to 
work within the network to prevent and eradicate child labor.</p>
<p>Child labor remained a problem in the informal and illicit sectors. 
Although the government did not publish data on child labor, the 
National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) collected and 
published information on the economic activities of children between the
 ages of five and 17 through a module in its Comprehensive Household 
Economic Survey during the fourth quarter of each calendar year. 
According to DANEâs most recent survey, conducted in 2018, 5.9 percent 
of children were working, with 43 percent of those engaged in 
agriculture, livestock raising, fishing, and hunting and 28 percent in 
commerce, hotels, and restaurant work. To a lesser extent, children were
 engaged in the manufacturing and transport sectors. Children also 
routinely performed domestic work, where they cared for children, 
prepared meals, tended gardens, and carried out shopping duties. DANE 
reported that 48 percent of children who were economically engaged did 
not receive remuneration.</p>
<p>Significant rates of child labor occurred in the production of clay 
bricks, coal, coffee, emeralds, gold, coca, pornography, and sugarcane. 
Forced child labor was prevalent in the production of coca. Children 
were also engaged in street vending, domestic work, begging, and garbage
 scavenging. There were reports that children engaged in child labor in 
agriculture, including coffee production and small family production 
centers in the unrefined brown sugar market, as well as selling 
inexpensive Venezuelan gasoline. Commercial sexual exploitation of 
children occurred (see section 6, Children).</p>
<p>Prohibitions against children working in mining and construction were
 reportedly largely ignored. Some educational institutions modify 
schedules during harvest seasons so that children may help on the family
 farm. Children worked in the artisanal mining of coal, clay, emeralds, 
and gold under dangerous conditions and in many instances with the 
approval or insistence of their parents. The governmentâs efforts to 
assist children working in illegal mining focused on the departments of 
Amazonas, Antioquia, Bolivar, Boyaca, Caldas, Cauca, Cesar, Choco, 
Cordoba, Cundinamarca, La Guajira, Narino, Norte de Santander, and Valle
 del Cauca.</p>
<p>There continued to be instances of child trafficking with the purpose
 of forced labor in mines, quarries, and private homes. According to 
government officials and international organizations, illegal drug 
traders and other illicit actors recruited children, sometimes forcibly,
 to work in their illegal activities. The ELN and organized-crime gangs 
forced children into sexual servitude or criminality to serve as 
combatants or coca pickers (see section 1.g.). Children working in the 
informal sector, including as street vendors, were also vulnerable to 
labor trafficking. The ICBF identified children and adolescents who 
qualified for and received social services.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination with respect to employment or 
occupation based on race, ethnicity, sex, religion, political 
preference, national origin or citizenship, gender, disability, 
language, sexual orientation or gender identity, HIV-positive status or 
infection with other communicable diseases, or social status. Complaints
 of quid pro quo sexual harassment are filed not with the Ministry of 
Labor but with the criminal courts. The government did not effectively 
enforce the law in all cases.</p>
<p>Unemployment disproportionately affected women, who faced hiring 
discrimination and received salaries that generally were not 
commensurate with their education and experience. The NGO Sisma Mujer 
reported that on average women were paid 28 percent less than men. In a 
previous year, a senior government official estimated that 85 percent of
 persons with disabilities were unemployed. Afro-Colombian labor unions 
reported discrimination in the port sector.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>The legal minimum monthly wage is approximately twice the amount
 of the poverty line; however, almost one-half of the total workforce 
earned less than the minimum wage.</p>
<p>The law provides for a regular workweek of 48 hours and a minimum 
rest period of eight hours within the week. Exceptions to this may be 
granted by the Ministry of Labor and were frequently granted in the 
mining sector. The law stipulates that workers receive premium 
compensation for nighttime work, hours worked in excess of 48 per week, 
and work performed on Sundays. The law permits compulsory overtime only 
in exceptional cases where the work is considered essential for the 
companyâs functioning.</p>
<p>The law provides for workersâ occupational safety and health in the 
formal sector. The legal standards were generally up to date and 
appropriate for the main formal industries. The law does not cover 
informal-sector workers, including many mining and agricultural workers.
 In general, the law protects workersâ rights to remove themselves from 
situations that endanger health or safety without jeopardy to their 
employment, although some violations of this right were reported during 
the year. In cases of formal grievances, authorities generally protected
 employees in this situation.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor is required to enforce labor laws in the formal
 sector, including occupational safety and health regulations, through 
periodic inspections by labor inspectors. The number of inspectors was 
insufficient to enforce the law effectively. In April 2018 the Civil 
Service Commission held a national examination that provided 
opportunities for labor inspectors in provisional appointments to become
 permanently hired inspectors. Many of these inspectors failed to pass 
the examination, however, resulting in high turnover during the year. In
 August the Ministry of Labor reported that approximately 245 inspectors
 remained in provisional status. Individual labor violations can result 
in penalties insufficient to deter violations. Unionists stated that 
more fines needed to be collected to impact occupational safety and 
health problems.</p>
<p>While the governmentâs labor inspectors undertook administrative 
actions to enforce the minimum wage in the formal sector, the government
 did not effectively enforce the law in the informal sector.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor continued to promote formal employment 
generation. As of July, DANE reported that 50.6 percent of workers 
employed in 13 principal cities were paying into the pension system. The
 proportion of informal workers in 23 cities and metropolitan areas 
surveyed was 47.5 percent, according to DANE. The government continued 
to support complementary social security programs to increase the 
employability of extremely poor individuals, displaced persons, and the 
elderly.</p>
<p>Nonunion workers, particularly those in the agricultural and port 
sectors, reportedly worked under hazardous conditions because they 
feared losing their jobs through subcontracting mechanisms or informal 
arrangements if they reported abuses. Some unionized workers who alleged
 they suffered on-the-job injuries complained that companies illegally 
fired them in retaliation for filing workers compensation claims. Only 
the courts may order reinstatement, and workers complained the courts 
were backlogged, slow, and corrupt. The Ministry of Labor may sanction a
 company found to have broken the law in this way, but it may offer no 
other guarantees to workers.</p>
<p>Security forces reported that illegal armed actors, including FARC 
dissidents, the ELN, and organized-crime groups, engaged in illegal 
mining of gold, coal, coltan, nickel, copper, and other minerals. 
Illegal mines were particularly common in the departments of Antioquia, 
Boyaca, Choco, Cundinamarca, and Valle del Cauca.</p>
<p>According to the National Mining Agency, through August 7, a total of
 56 workers died as a result of accidents in the mines, the majority due
 to cave-ins.</p>
