				<h2 id="report-toc__exec-summary" class="report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

				<p>Peru is a constitutional, multiparty republic. President Martin 
Vizcarra assumed the presidency in March 2018 following the resignation 
of then president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski when Vizcarra was vice 
president. Kuczynski won the 2016 national elections in a vote widely 
considered free and fair. Invoking articles of the constitution, 
President Vizcarra dissolved Congress on September 30. Legislative 
elections are scheduled for January 2020.</p>
<p>The national police, who report to the Ministry of Interior, maintain
 internal security. The military, reporting to the Ministry of Defense, 
is responsible for external security but also has some domestic security
 responsibilities in exceptional circumstances and in designated 
emergency areas. Civilian authorities generally maintained effective 
control over the security forces.</p>
<p>Significant human rights issues included isolated cases of torture; 
government corruption at all levels, including in the judiciary; sexual 
exploitation, including human trafficking; violence against women and 
girls; and forced labor.</p>
<p>The government took steps to investigate and in some cases prosecute 
or otherwise punish public officials, including high-level officials, 
accused of abuses.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings.</p>
<p>In September a judge ordered 36 months of pretrial detention for 
former Peruvian National Police (PNP) commander Raul Prado Ravines, 
accused of leading an extrajudicial killing squad. The case involved the
 suspected extrajudicial killing of more than 27 criminal suspects 
during at least nine separate police operations from 2012 to 2015 to 
cover up police corruption and to receive awards and promotions. 
Fourteen PNP police officers remained in preventive detention, eight in 
prison and six under house arrest, awaiting trial for their roles in the
 operations. Also in September, in a separate case, courts sentenced PNP
 officer and former mayor of Trujillo, Elidio Espinoza, to 30 years in 
prison for leading a death squad that killed four persons in 2007. The 
sentence was under appeal.</p>
<p>The Shining Path domestic terrorist group conducted several terrorist
 acts during the year that killed and injured security force members, 
including the June 25 killing of three soldiers during an operation in 
the town of Vizcatan in Junin Province and the August 9 killing of a 
soldier during an operation in Huanta Province.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Disappearance</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justiceâs Directorate for Disappeared Persons 
oversees the recovery, identification, and return of remains of the 
approximately 13,000-20,000 persons who disappeared during the internal 
conflict of 1980-2000. From January through August, the directorate 
facilitated the return of the remains of 162 disappeared persons. In 
September the directorate reported the genetic database created in 2018 
to identify and recover these victimsâ remains contained 500 genetic 
profiles to assist with the task of searching for missing persons.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits such practices, but there were reports that 
government officials employed them. Local nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs) and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman reported that 
torture by police occurred and stated the government did not effectively
 prevent torture or punish those who committed such abuses.</p>
<p>According to the local NGO Human Rights Commission, many victims did 
not file formal complaints about their alleged torture, and those who 
did so purportedly had difficulty obtaining judicial redress and 
adequate compensation.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h3>

					
					<p>Prison conditions were generally harsh due to overcrowding, poor
 sanitation, inadequate nutrition and health care, and corruption among 
guards, which included guards smuggling weapons and drugs into the 
prisons. Guards received little to no training or supervision.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: As of June the National Penitentiary 
Institute reported the system had 94,235 prisoners in 69 facilities 
designed for a total of 39,156 prisoners. Examples of particularly 
overcrowded prisons included the San Juan de Lurigancho menâs prison, 
which held 10,842 prisoners in a facility designed for 3,204, and the 
Santa Monica womenâs prison in Chorrillos, which held 741 prisoners in a
 facility designed for 450.</p>
<p>Assaults on inmates by prison guards and fellow inmates occurred 
regularly, and killings among prisoners were reported. Psychological 
abuses, such as stripping prisoners naked, handcuffing them, and making 
them stand outside their cells or parading them through general 
population, as well as the arbitrary use of solitary confinement, were 
also reported.</p>
<p>Inmates had only intermittent access to potable water, bathing 
facilities were inadequate, kitchen facilities were unhygienic, and 
prisoners often slept in hallways and common areas due to lack of cell 
space. Prisoners with money or other resources had access to cell 
phones, illegal drugs, and better meals prepared outside the prison; 
prisoners who lacked funds experienced much more difficult conditions.</p>
<p>Most prisons provided severely limited access to medical care, which 
resulted in delayed diagnoses of illnesses. Inmates lacked access to 
required daily medication for chronic conditions, including diabetes and
 heart disease, leading to subsequent complications, such as blindness 
and limb amputation. There was a shortage of doctors, and inmates 
complained of having to pay for medical attention. Tuberculosis and 
HIV/AIDS reportedly remained at near-epidemic levels. The Ombudsmanâs 
Office reported insufficient accessibility and inadequate facilities for
 prisoners with disabilities. Prisons lacked specialized medical 
equipment needed for prisoners with disabilities, such as wheelchairs 
and hospital transfer beds. Prisoners with mental disabilities and 
mental health conditions lacked access to adequate psychological care.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: Independent and government authorities investigated credible allegations of mistreatment.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: The government permitted monitoring 
visits by independent human rights and international humanitarian law 
observers. International Committee of the Red Cross officials made 
unannounced visits to inmates in prisons and detention centers. During 
the year representatives of the Ombudsmanâs Office visited prisons in 
Lima and the provinces.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention
 and provide for the right of any person to challenge in court the 
lawfulness of his or her arrest or detention. The government generally 
observed these requirements. The government constitutionally suspended 
the right to freedom from arrest without warrant in designated emergency
 zones.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>The law requires a written judicial warrant based on sufficient 
evidence for an arrest, unless authorities apprehend the alleged 
perpetrator of a crime in the act. Only judges may authorize detentions.
 Authorities are required to arraign arrested persons within 24 hours, 
except in cases of suspected terrorism, drug trafficking, or espionage, 
for which arraignment must take place within 15 days. In remote areas, 
arraignment must take place as soon as practicable. Military authorities
 must turn over persons they detain to police within 24 hours. Police 
must file a report with the Public Ministry, the autonomous Public 
Prosecutorâs Office, within 24 hours of an arrest. The Public Ministry, 
in turn, must issue its own assessment of the legality of the police 
action in the arrest; authorities respected this requirement.</p>
<p>The law permits detainees to have access to family members and a 
lawyer of their choice. Police may detain suspected terrorists 
incommunicado for 10 days.</p>
<p><u>Pretrial Detention</u>: Lengthy pretrial detention continued to be
 a problem. According to an April report by the National Penitentiary 
Institute, 39 percent of prisoners in Peru were being held under 
pretrial detention. The length of pretrial detention occasionally 
equaled, but did not exceed, the maximum sentence of the alleged crime. 
Delays were due mainly to judicial inefficiency, corruption, and staff 
shortages. In accordance with the law, courts released prisoners held 
more than nine months (up to 36 months in complex cases) whom the 
justice system had not tried and sentenced. The courts factored pretrial
 detention into final sentences.</p>
<p>In September the Supreme Court published revised guidelines for 
ordering pretrial detention. First, the court stated that pretrial 
detention can be ordered if there is a high probability the suspect will
 be sentenced for the crime under investigation. Second, prosecutors 
requesting pretrial detention need to provide convincing evidence and at
 least one witness. Third, the court declared pretrial detention may be 
used only if the sentence corresponding to the crime is greater than 
four years. Finally, prosecutors must present concrete evidence that the
 accused individual is a flight risk or could obstruct the case if he or
 she were free. Prosecutors must follow the revised guidelines when 
ordering pretrial detention, and the Constitutional Tribunal may 
consider the guidelines for current cases of pretrial detention as they 
deliberate habeas corpus requests.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for an independent judiciary. Some 
NGOs and other advocates alleged the judiciary did not always operate 
independently, was not consistently impartial, and was sometimes subject
 to political influence and corruption.</p>
<p>In July 2018 media outlets released audiotapes of telephone 
conversations of judges implicating themselves in influence peddling, 
which included court decisions. These conversations uncovered a 
widespread network of corrupt practices and political interference in 
judicial decisions. Immediately following the scandal, President 
Vizcarra implemented measures to address judicial corruption, including 
replacing the National Council of Magistrates with a National Board of 
Justice. The National Council of Magistrates, the body in charge of 
selecting, evaluating, and punishing judges and prosecutors, was at the 
heart of the corruption scandal. The National Board of Justice maintains
 the same responsibilities as the council but is selected through a 
competitive public application process. As of September the selection 
and establishment of the board were pending due to missteps and delays 
in the process.</p>
<p>Authorities generally respected court orders from the judiciary.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Trial Procedures</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the right to a fair and public trial, and 
the judiciary generally enforced this right, although reports of 
corruption in the judicial system were common. The government continued 
the implementation, begun in 2006, of the transition from an 
inquisitorial to an accusatory legal system and the application of a new
 criminal procedure code to streamline the penal process. As of October 
the government had initiated the transition and introduced the code in 
32 of the 34 judicial districts. Implementation in the largest judicial 
districtsâLima and South Limaâremained pending.</p>
<p>The law presumes all defendants are innocent. The government must 
promptly inform defendants in detail of the charges against them and 
provide defendants a trial without undue delay. Defendants have the 
right to be present at their trial and to communicate with an attorney 
of their choice or have one provided at public expense. State-provided 
attorneys, however, often had poor training. Although the law grants 
citizens the right to trial in their own language, interpretation and 
translation services for non-Spanish speakers were sometimes 
unavailable. This deficiency primarily affected indigenous persons 
living in the highlands and Amazon regions.</p>
<p>The law provides that all defendants have the right to adequate time 
and facilities to prepare for their defense. Defendants have the right 
to confront adverse witnesses and present their own witnesses and 
evidence. The government cannot compel defendants to testify or confess 
to a crime. Defendants may appeal verdicts to a higher court and 
ultimately to the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Tribunal may rule on
 cases involving issues such as habeas corpus or the constitutionality 
of laws.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-10" class="report__section-subtitle">Civil Judicial Procedures and Remedies</h3>

					
					<p>Citizens may seek civil remedies for human rights violations, 
but court cases often take years to resolve. Press reports, NGOs, and 
other sources continued to allege that persons outside the judiciary 
frequently corrupted or influenced judges.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-11" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Arbitrary or Unlawful Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits such actions, and there were no reports that 
the government failed to respect these prohibitions. The governmentâs 
continued declaration of an emergency zone in the Valley of the 
Apurimac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers (VRAEM), due to drug trafficking and 
criminal activity, suspended the right to home inviolability there.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for freedom of expression, including 
for the press, and the government generally respected this right. An 
independent press and a functioning democratic political system 
generally promoted freedom of expression, including for the press. 
According to the Interamerican Press Society, an increase in the number 
of civil libel and slander lawsuits and lengthy court cases threatened 
freedom of expression and freedom of the press.</p>
<p><u>Violence and Harassment</u>: Journalists alleged that police, 
protesters, and company personnel assaulted and threatened them while 
covering various protests and incidents of social unrest. In one such 
incident in September, police officers attacked a journalist covering 
protests in Puno. The Ombudsmanâs Office recommended the PNP investigate
 the alleged assault.</p>
<p><u>Censorship or Content Restrictions</u>: NGOs continued to report 
that some media, most notably in the provinces outside of Lima, 
practiced self-censorship due to fear of local government reprisal.</p>
<p><u>Nongovernmental Impact</u>: Some media reported narcotics 
traffickers and persons engaged in illegal mining threatened press 
freedom by intimidating local journalists who reported on those 
activities.</p>

					<p>The law does not require a permit for public demonstrations, but
 organizers must report the type of demonstration planned and coordinate
 its intended location with authorities. The government continued to 
suspend freedom of assembly in the VRAEM and La Pampa emergency zones, 
where armed elements of the Shining Path and drug traffickers operated, 
as well as in regions suffering from crime and public health crises.</p>
<p>The government may restrict or prohibit demonstrations at specific

gas and force occasionally to disperse protesters in various 
demonstrations, including at a major public university. Although most 
demonstrations were peaceful, protests in some areas turned violent, 
resulting in one death and multiple injuries in May (see section 6, 
Other Societal Violence or Discrimination).</p>

					<p>The law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign 
travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the government generally 
respected these rights.</p>
<p><u>In-country Movement</u>: Due to the presence of the Shining Path, 
drug trafficking, and transnational organized crime, the government 
maintained an emergency zone in the VRAEM and parts of four regions 
where authorities restricted freedom of movement in an effort to 
maintain public peace and restore internal order.</p>
<p>Narcotics traffickers and Shining Path members at times interrupted 
the free movement of persons by establishing roadblocks in sections of 
the VRAEM emergency zone. Individuals protesting against extractive

					<p>The Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populationsâ National 
Registry for Displaced Persons estimated there were 59,846 displaced 
persons in the country, many of whom are victims of the 1980-2000 
internal conflict. The registration and accreditation of displaced 
persons provides for their protection, care, and humanitarian assistance
 during displacement, return, or resettlement. According to the 
governmentâs Reparations Council, some internally displaced persons who 
were victims of the 1980-2000 internal conflict experienced difficulties
 registering for reparations due to the lack of proper identity

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-9" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Protection of Refugees</h3>

					
					<p>As of July more than one million foreign-born persons lived in 
the country. In December 2018 the government discontinued the 
application for one-year temporary residence permits (PTPs) targeted at 
Venezuelans, who numbered more than 860,000. PTP holders can legally 
reside and work in the country. During the 23 months when PTPs were 
issued (February 2017 to December 2018), the government granted 486,000 
permits. Before a PTP expires, the holder must adjust to a more 
permanent migratory status, including a âspecial migratory resident 
statusâ designed for PTP holders who certify economic activity and no 
criminal record. This status adjustment results in a foreign resident 
identification, equivalent in most ways to a Peruvian citizenâs national
 identification.</p>
<p><u>Access to Asylum</u>: The law provides for the granting of asylum 
or refugee status, and the government has established a system for 
protecting refugees. The government cooperated with the Office of the UN
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and recognized the Peruvian 
Catholic Migration Commission as the official provider of technical 
assistance to refugees. The commission also advised citizens who sought 
asylum based on a fear of persecution. The government protected refugees
 on a renewable, year-to-year basis, in accordance with commission 
recommendations.</p>
<p><u>Employment</u>: According to a September UNHCR report, 62 percent 
of Venezuelans surveyed in the cities of Cusco, Lima, Arequipa, Tumbes, 
and Tacna believed they had been targets of discrimination, particularly
 because of their nationality. Following decrees limiting the employment
 of foreigners in the cities of Cusco and Huancayo, the Ombudsmanâs 
Office issued a public statement in March characterizing the decrees as 
promoting discriminatory conduct that reinforces stereotypes of 
Venezuelan migrants. Human rights advocates challenged the decrees in 
courts, and prosecutors denounced the mayor of Huancayo for inciting 
discrimination. The Cusco decree was amended to focus on penalizing the 
practice of arbitrarily dismissing workers and replacing them with 
persons willing to work at a lower wage.</p>
<p><u>Durable Solutions</u>: The government does not have a formalized 
integration program for refugees, but it received persons recognized as 
refugees by other nations, granted refugee status to persons who applied
 from within Peru, and provided some administrative support toward their
 integration. UNHCR provided these refugees with humanitarian and 
emergency aid, legal assistance, documentation, and, in exceptional 
cases, voluntary return and family reunification.</p>
<p><u>Temporary Protection</u>: As of August the government provided 
temporary protection to more than 277,000 individuals awaiting a 
decision on their refugee status. The government provided these 
individuals with temporary residence permits and authorization to work.</p>

					<p><u>Recent Elections</u>: Elections were held in April 2016 (for 
president, the National Congress, and the Andean Parliament) and in June
 2016 (a second round for the presidential race only). Domestic and 
international observers declared the elections to be fair and 
transparent, despite controversy over the exclusion of two presidential 
candidates for administrative violations of election-related laws. Pedro
 Pablo Kuczynski won and assumed the presidency in July 2016 after the 
second round of presidential elections. Martin Vizcarra was Kuczynskiâs 
first vice president. President Kuczynski resigned in March 2018, a few 
days before his impeachment hearing on corruption allegations. Pursuant 
to the constitution, in March 2018 First Vice President Vizcarra assumed
 the presidency following Kuczynskiâs resignation.</p>
<p>Two rounds of regional elections for governorships and municipal 
offices were held in October and December 2018. Observers declared the 
elections to be peaceful, free, and fair.</p>
<p>Legislative elections are scheduled for January 2020 following 
President Vizcarraâs dissolution of Congress on September 30. The 
opposition presented a challenge to the dissolution in the 
Constitutional Tribunal. Most analysts assessed that the executive 
branchâs action was constitutionally permissible and that the tribunalâs
 review of the case was unlikely to affect the election. There were 
small, largely peaceful protests both in favor of and opposed to the 
presidentâs September 30 actions.</p>
<p><u>Political Parties and Political Participation</u>: By law groups 
that advocate the violent overthrow of the government and adhere to 
ideologies intrinsically incompatible with democracy cannot register as 
political parties.</p>
<p><u>Participation of Women and Minorities</u>: No laws limit 
participation of women or members of minorities in the political 
process, and they did participate. In July, Congress approved a gradual 
increase of the gender quota in congressional lists (lists of candidates
 presented by political parties for district elections) from the 
existing 30 percent to 40 percent by 2021, 45 percent by 2026, and 
parity (50 percent) by 2031.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for corruption by officials;
 however, the government did not always implement the law effectively, 
and officials often engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. There 
were numerous reports of corruption by government officials during the 
year. Citizens continued to view corruption as a pervasive problem in 
all branches of national, regional, and local governments.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: Several high-profile political figures were under 
investigation for corruption, particularly in relation to the well 
publicized Odebrecht corruption scandal. Former president Pedro Pablo 
Kuczynski (2016-18), who resigned in 2018 in the wake of a corruption 
scandal, was under house arrest pending charges against him. Former 
president Ollanta Humala (2011-16) and his wife Nadine Heredia remained 
under investigation on charges of money-laundering campaign donations. 
Their pretrial detention was annulled by the Constitutional Tribunal in 
2018. Former president Alan Garcia (1985-90, 2006-11) died by suicide in
 April when police arrived at his residence to detain him under a 10-day
 preliminary arrest warrant on corruption charges. Former president 
Alejandro Toledo (2001-06) was in preventive detention in the United 
States awaiting extradition for allegedly accepting bribes during his 
administration. In November the Constitutional Tribunal approved a 
habeas corpus request to free two-time presidential candidate Keiko 
Fujimori from preventive detention while the investigation continued on 
charges of her obstruction of justice and money-laundering campaign 
donations.</p>
<p>There was evidence of widespread corruption in the judicial system. 
Prosecutors launched an investigation following 2018 media reports of a 
judicial scandal involving allegations of influence peddling and graft 
by various judges at all levels. In February a specialized team of 
prosecutors signed an agreement between the government and Brazilian 
company Odebrecht under which several corporate officials would 
collaborate with justice authorities to detail Odebrechtâs corruption 
schemes in Peru.</p>
<p>PNP officials at all levels were implicated in corruption scandals 
during the year. In September, PNP commander Manuel Hiraldo Morillo 
Cribilleros, head of the Criminal Division of Puerto Maldonado in the 
Madre de Dios region, was arrested during a large-scale law enforcement 
operation targeting the Los Brothers human trafficking ring. Morillo was
 suspected of being involved in sex trafficking and corruption.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: Most public officials must submit 
personal financial information to the Office of the Comptroller General 
prior to taking office and periodically thereafter. The comptroller 
monitors and verifies disclosures, but the law was not strongly 
enforced. Administrative punishments for noncompliance can include 
suspension between 30 days and one year, a ban on signing government 
contracts, and a ban on holding government office. The comptroller makes
 disclosures available to the public. The comptroller reported only 22 
audits were conducted for the 50,000 public official disclosures in 
2017. In July, Congress approved an executive proposal to strengthen 
penalties against anonymous campaign donations.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A variety of domestic and international human rights groups 
generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
were somewhat cooperative and responsive to their views.</p>
<p>Human rights and environmental activists continued to express concern
 for their safety while working in areas with a lot of natural resource 
extraction, including illegal logging and mining. They alleged local 
authorities harassed activists, especially in areas where officials 
faced corruption charges and suspicion of links to criminal activities. 
The activists claimed the slow, ineffective process for punishing 
harassers effectively supported impunity.</p>
<p><u>Government Human Rights Bodies</u>: The Ministry of Justice and 
Human Rights, and in particular the Vice Ministry of Human Rights and 
Access to Justice, oversees human rights issues at the national level. 
The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable 
Populations also have significant human rights roles. These government 
bodies were generally considered effective.</p>
<p>The independent Office of the Ombudsman operated without government 
or party interference, and NGOs, civil society organizations, and the 
public considered it effective.</p>
<p>Congressional committees overseeing human rights included Justice and
 Human Rights; Women and the Family; Labor and Social Security; Andean, 
Amazonian, Afro-Peruvian Peoples and Environment and Ecology; Health and
 Population; and Social Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">Women</h3>

					
					<p><u>Rape and Domestic Violence</u>: The law criminalizes rape of 
men and women, including spousal rape. Penalties for this crime are a 
minimum of 14 years and a maximum of life in prison.</p>
<p>The law defines femicide as the killing of a woman or girl based on 
expectations, assumptions, or factors distinctive to her gender. The 
minimum sentence for femicide is 20 years, and 30 years when the crime 
includes aggravating circumstances (e.g., crimes against minor, elderly,
 or pregnant victims). Enforcement of these laws was often ineffective.</p>
<p>The law prohibits domestic violence; penalties range from one month 
to six years in prison. The law authorizes judges and prosecutors to 
prevent a convicted spouse or parent from returning to the family home. 
The law also authorizes the victimâs relatives and unrelated persons 
living in the home to file complaints of domestic violence. The law 
requires a police investigation of domestic violence to take place 
within five days of a complaint and obliges authorities to extend 
protection to female victims of domestic violence. Enforcement of these 
laws was lax.</p>
<p>Violence against women and girlsâincluding rape, spousal abuse, and 
sexual, physical, and psychological abuseâwas a serious national problem
 with increased visibility. The Ministry of Women and Vulnerable 
Populations continued to operate service centers with police, 
prosecutors, counselors, and public welfare agents to help victims. NGOs
 expressed concerns about the quality and quantity of the programâs 
services, particularly in rural areas. The ministry operated a toll-free
 hotline and implemented projects to sensitize government employees and 
the citizenry to domestic violence. The government continued efforts to 
expand temporary shelters, but NGOs and members of Congress stated there
 were not enough.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Harassment</u>: Sexual harassment remained a serious 
problem. Sexual harassment is defined as comments, touching, or actions 
of a sexual nature that are unsolicited and unwanted by victim. It is a 
crime with a penalty of up to eight years in prison. Sexual harassment 
is also a labor rights violation subject to administrative penalties. 
Government enforcement of laws against sexual harassment remained 
minimal, although awareness was growing.</p>
<p>In September courts convicted a person of sexual harassment and 
imposed a sentence of four years and eight months in prison. This was 
the first-ever conviction for sexual harassment of an adult victim.</p>
<p><u>Coercion in Population Control</u>: There were no reports of coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: The law provides for equality between men and 
women and prohibits discrimination against women with regard to 
marriage, divorce, pregnancy, pay, and property rights. The government 
did not enforce the law effectively. While the law prohibits 
discrimination in employment and educational opportunities based on 
gender, there was a persistent underrepresentation of women in 
high-ranking positions. Arbitrary dismissal of pregnant women and 
workplace discrimination against women were common. The law stipulates 
that women should receive equal pay for equal work, but women often were
 paid less than men. The National Institute of Statistics estimated 
that, as of 2018, womenâs earnings were an average of 68 percent of 
their male counterpartsâ earnings.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Children</h3>

					
					<p><u>Birth Registration</u>: Citizenship is derived either by 
birth within the countryâs territory or from oneâs parents. The state 
grants a national identification number upon birth, which is essential 
to access most public and many private services. Government 
representatives and NGOs assessed that undocumented citizens were 
particularly vulnerable to labor exploitation, human trafficking, and 
crime.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: Violence against children and sexual abuse of 
children were serious nationwide problems. At-risk children may be 
placed with guardians or in specialized residential facilities for 
different kinds of victims. Not all shelters provided psychological 
care, although the law requires it. In most regions, residential 
shelters operated by provincial or district authorities were 
supplemented by shelters operated by schools, churches, and NGOs.</p>
<p>The law requires all government authorities, courts, and social 
service institutions to use the âbest interests of the childâ standard 
in all decisions affecting these children. The law imposes stiff prison 
sentences for sexual exploitation of children, abusing minors, and child
 trafficking, but these crimes were sometimes confused with each other. 
As a result, police did not always collect the correct kind of evidence 
to meet the prosecutorâs evidentiary burden, and judges at times failed 
to apply relevant penalty provisions, particularly in trafficking cases.</p>
<p><u>Early and Forced Marriage</u>: The legal minimum age of marriage is 18. The law allows a civil judge to authorize minors older than 16 to marry.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: The law prohibits child 
pornography and stipulates a penalty of four to 12 yearsâ imprisonment 
and a fine. The law prohibits child sex trafficking, with a minimum 
penalty of 12 years in prison. Government officials, police, NGOs, civil
 society leaders, and journalists identified numerous cases of child sex
 trafficking during the year. The country remained a destination for 
child sex tourism.</p>
<p>While the country has strong laws to protect children, it frequently 
had serious problems with enforcement. Media reported on the sex 
trafficking of minor girls in the illicit gold mining sites of the 
remote Amazonian Madre de Dios region. In 2018 a local NGO estimated 
there were approximately 400 brothels in the Madre de Dios mining 
region, with hundreds of minor girls living in debt bondage and 
subjected to sex trafficking. In February the PNP and the armed forces 
launched an enforcement campaign in Madre de Dios to eliminate illegal 
gold mining and its related crimes, including human trafficking.</p>
<p>The minimum age for consensual sex is 14. A conviction for rape of a 
child younger than 14 carries penalties ranging from 25 years to life in
 prison. The law also prohibits adults from using deceit, abuse of 
power, or taking advantage of a child in a vulnerable situation to have 
sex with a person younger than 18.</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is a party to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs <i>Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction</i> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210202004735/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data/reported-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://

					<p>Estimates of the Jewish population ranged from 3,000 to 4,000 
persons. Jewish community leaders said some individuals continued to 
engage occasionally in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on social media.
 They said the government and both private and government-run media 
generally did not engage in this activity. In January, Junin Governor 
Vladimir Cerron tweeted, âIf the Left coordinates its unity well, it 
will successfully face the Jewish-Peruvian powers in the next general 
elections.â In February, two months before dying by suicide to avoid 
arrest for a corruption investigation, former president Alan Garcia said
 a journalist who accused him of stopping the fight against corruption 
had âbrought the Jewish mafia of (Josef) Maimanâ to Peru. (Josef Maiman 
is an Israeli-Peruvian real estate developer implicated in corruption 
charges.) Some political leaders and media reports criticized the 
remarks by Cerron and Garcia.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Persons with Disabilities</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination against persons with 
disabilities, defined as an individual who has a physical, sensory, or 
mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities. The law
 establishes infractions and punishments for noncompliance. The law also
 provides for the protection, care, rehabilitation, security, and social
 inclusion of persons with disabilities. It mandates that public spaces 
be free of barriers and be accessible to persons with disabilities. It 
provides for the appointment of a disability rights specialist in the 
Ombudsmanâs Office. The law mandates the government make its internet 
sites accessible for persons with disabilities. It requires the 
inclusion of sign language or subtitles in all educational and cultural 
programs on public television and in media available in public 
libraries. The government generally did not effectively enforce these 
laws.</p>
<p>In September the government issued the General Law on People with 
Disabilities, requiring companies to improve their job selection 
processes to give persons with disabilities the opportunity to apply for
 jobs on equal terms. The law also requires employers to provide 
employees up to 56 hours per year to accompany their disabled relatives 
to medical appointments.</p>
<p>The government failed to enforce laws protecting the rights of 
persons with mental disabilities. NGOs and government officials reported
 an insufficient number of medical personnel providing services in 
psychiatric institutions.</p>
<p>While government officials improved enforcement of the rights of 
persons with disabilities, the countryâs disabled community still faced 
immense challenges due to inaccessible infrastructure, minimal access to
 education, insufficient employment opportunities, and discrimination, 
according to government and civil society leaders. The Ombudsmanâs 
Office reported approximately 87 percent of children with disabilities 
did not attend school, and 76 percent of persons with disabilities did 
not work. One government survey reported that 70 percent of employers 
stated they would not hire a person with a disability.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities</h3>

					
					<p>The law requires the government to treat all citizens equally 
and it prohibits discrimination based on race, national origin, or 
language. The government did not always enforce the law effectively.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">Indigenous People</h3>

					
					<p>Indigenous communities remained politically, economically, and 
socially disadvantaged. Indigenous persons continued to face threats 
from land grabbers, narcotics traffickers, illegal miners, and illegal 
loggers who operated near or within indigenous land holdings, often in 
the Amazon. Indigenous persons were particularly at risk for human 
trafficking. Indigenous leaders expressed concerns that the national and
 regional governments did not adequately protect indigenous peoples and 
their property interests.</p>
<p>While the constitution recognizes that indigenous peoples have the 
right to own land communally, indigenous groups often lacked legal title
 to demarcate the boundaries of their land. Amazonian indigenous peoples
 in particular continued to accuse the national government of delaying 
the final allocation of their land titles. By law local communities 
retain the right of unassignability, which should prevent the title to 
such lands from being reassigned to a nonindigenous person. Some 
indigenous community members, however, sold land to outsiders without 
the majority consent of their community.</p>
<p>The national government retains subsurface mineral rights for land 
nationwide. This led to disputes between local indigenous communities, 
the national government, regional governments, and the various 
extractive interests. The law requires the government to consult with 
indigenous communities on proposed extractive projects or on changes to 
ongoing extractive projects. The government is required to produce a 
detailed implementation plan to facilitate government and private-sector
 compliance; implementation of this law was somewhat effective. The law 
also requires the Ministry of Culture to establish a database of 
indigenous communities entitled to consultation. As of 2018 the ministry
 had recognized 55 indigenous groups as being entitled to âprior 
consultation.â From 2014 to October 2019, the government initiated 24 
prior consultations with various indigenous communities, which generated
 487 agreements. Of the prior consultations, 10 were concluded and 14 
continued.</p>
<p>NGOs, legal experts, and the Ombudsmanâs Office continued to express 
concern that indigenous communities did not have sufficient training to 
engage in consultations with the government and extractive industries.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h3>

					
					<p>The law recognizes the right of individuals to file legal claims
 of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Four 
regional governments (Piura, La Libertad, Loreto, and San Martin) have 
regulations that explicitly prohibit discrimination against lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons and provide 
administrative relief but not criminal sanctions.</p>
<p>Government officials, NGOs, journalists, and civil-society leaders 
reported widespread official and societal discrimination against LGBTI 
persons in employment, housing, education, and health care based on 
sexual orientation or gender identity. NGOs continued to report that law
 enforcement authorities repeatedly failed to protect, and on occasion 
violated, the rights of LGBTI citizens. Police harassment and abuse of 
transgender women remained a problem. Transgender women reported to NGOs
 that municipal police in metropolitan Lima and other major cities 
engaged in extortion, violence, and degrading treatment against them. 
LGBTI persons were particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.</p>
<p>NGOs also reported an increase in forced or coerced conversion 
therapy. In August the Ombudsmanâs Office expressed its concern and its 
rejection of establishments that seek to modify the sexual orientation 
or gender identity of LGBTI persons. The ombudsman recommended 
investigations of these establishments by the Peruvian College of 
Psychologists, the Medical College of Peru, and the Public Ministry.</p>
<p>The law does not provide transgender persons the right to update 
their national identity documents to reflect their gender identity. 
Transgender persons, therefore, often did not have valid national 
identification cards, which consequently limited their access to 
government services.</p>

					<p>Persons with HIV/AIDS faced discrimination and harassment, 
including societal discrimination, with respect to employment, housing, 
and social inclusion. The Ministry of Health implemented policies to 
combat discrimination based on HIV/AIDS status. HIV/AIDS affected 
transgender women disproportionately, and many of them could not obtain 
health care because they lacked national identification cards reflecting
 their gender and appearance.</p>

conflicts involved socioenvironmental issues, with mining-related 
incidents accounting for 63 percent of the cases. In May a private 
security force member died during a confrontation with residents of the 
Paran community in the department of Huanuco over alleged contamination 
of water by the Invicta Mining Corporation. Clashes in the Tambo Valley 
injured at least 26 police and several civilians during protests over a 
construction license for the Tia Maria mining project.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>With certain limitations, labor laws and regulations provide for
 freedom of association, the right to strike, and collective bargaining.
 The law prohibits intimidation by employers and other forms of 
antiunion discrimination. It requires reinstatement of workers fired for
 union activity, unless they opt to receive compensation instead. The 
law allows workers to form unions without seeking prior authorization. 
By law at least 20 workers must be affiliated to form an 
enterprise-level union and 50 workers must be affiliated to form a 
sector-wide union or federation. Some labor activists viewed this 
requirement as prohibitively high in some instances, particularly for 
small and medium-sized businesses, which represent 96.5 percent of all 
businesses. The use of unlimited consecutive short-term contracts in 
sectors such as textiles, apparel, and agriculture made the exercise of 
freedom of association and collective bargaining difficult.</p>
<p>The law allows unions to declare a strike in accordance with their 
governing documents. Private-sector workers must give at least five 
working-daysâ advance notice, and public-sector workers must give at 
least 10 working-daysâ notice. The law allows nonunion workers to 
declare a strike with a majority vote as long as the written voting 
record is notarized and announced at least five working days prior to 
the strike. Unions in essential services are permitted to call a strike 
but must provide 15 working-daysâ notice, receive the approval of the 
Ministry of Labor, obtain approval of a simple majority of workers, and 
provide a sufficient number of workers during a strike to maintain 
operations. Private enterprises and public institutions cannot fire 
workers who strike legally.</p>
<p>The law requires businesses to monitor their contractors with respect
 to labor rights, and it imposes liability on businesses for the actions
 of their contractors. Private-sector labor law sets out nine categories
 of short-term employment contracts that companies may use. The law sets
 time limits on contracts in each category and has a five-year overall 
limit on the consecutive use of short-term contracts. A sector-specific 
law covering parts of the textile and apparel sectors exempts employers 
from this five-year limit and allows employers to hire workers 
indefinitely on short-term contracts. In September, Congress renewed the
 agricultural promotion law, which provides for hiring, compensation, 
and vacation benefits for farmers until 2031.</p>
<p>The government did not effectively enforce the law. Although the 
Ministry of Labor and its National Superintendency of Labor Inspection 
(SUNAFIL) received budget increases in 2017 and 2018, resources remained
 inadequate to enforce freedom of association, collective bargaining, 
and other labor laws.</p>
<p>Penalties for violations of freedom of association and collective 
bargaining were insufficient to deter violations and, according to labor
 experts and union representatives, were rarely enforced. Workers 
continued to face prolonged judicial processes and lack of enforcement 
following dismissals for trade union activity. In October the Ministry 
of Labor created new services to protect unionization and freedom of 
association.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor, but 
the government did not effectively enforce the law. Forced labor and 
labor exploitation crimes continued to occur in domestic service, 
agriculture, forestry, mining, factories, counterfeit operations, brick 
making, and organized street begging.</p>
<p>Resources, inspections, and remediation were inadequate, and the law 
was not enforced effectively. The law prescribes penalties of eight to 
15 yearsâ imprisonment for labor trafficking. The government, due in 
part to weak enforcement and uneven application of the law, failed to 
deter violations.</p>
<p>SUNAFIL officials conducted inspections to identify forced labor. The
 Ministry of Labor and SUNAFIL trained SUNAFIL staff and nearly 3,000 
regional labor inspectors around the country to raise awareness of 
forced labor and the applicable law. In September the government 
approved the <i>National Plan against Forced Labor</i> for 2019-22. The 
plan aims to identify victims of forced labor, improve the governmentâs 
response to violations, restore rights that were violated, and give 
victims access to basic services, such as legal assistance, health care,
 and job training. The government also continued to implement the <i>National Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons 2017-21</i>.</p>
<p>Also see the Department of Stateâs <i>Trafficking in Persons Report</i> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210202004735/https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/</a>.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits most of the worst forms of child labor, but 
there is no prohibition of child recruitment by nonstate armed groups. 
The legal minimum age for employment is 14, although children between 
the ages of 12 and 14 may work in certain jobs for up to four hours per 
day. Adolescents between the ages of 15 and 17 may work up to six hours 
per day if they obtain special permission from the Ministry of Labor and
 certify that they are attending school. In certain sectors of the 
economy, higher age minimums exist: 15 in nonindustrial agriculture; 16 
in industry, commerce, and mining; and 17 in industrial fishing. The law
 specifically prohibits hiring minors in hazardous occupations, 
including working underground, lifting or carrying heavy weights, 
accepting responsibility for the safety of others, and working at night.
 The law allows a judge to authorize children who are 15 and older to 
engage in night work not exceeding four hours a day. The law prohibits 
work that jeopardizes the health of children and adolescents; puts their
 physical, mental, and emotional development at risk; or prevents 
regular attendance at school.</p>
<p>A permit from the Labor Ministry is required for persons younger than
 18 to work legally. Parents must apply for the permit, and employers 
must have a permit on file to hire a minor.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor and SUNAFIL are responsible for enforcing child
 labor laws, but enforcement was not effective, especially in the 
informal sector, where most child labor occurred.</p>
<p>In August the Labor Ministry signed a decree that establishes a 
public accreditation process for companies producing child-labor-free 
agricultural products.</p>
<p>A 2016 government report on child labor found that more than 26 
percent of children between the ages of five and 17 worked. The report 
noted child labor rates correlated closely with high poverty rates. The 
report found the rate of child labor was highest, at 46 percent, in 
rural, agricultural areas, whereas in urban areas the child labor rate 
was 13 percent.</p>
<p>Also, see the Department of Laborâs <i>Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor</i> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210202004735/https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/findings" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="external-link"><span class="external-link-title">https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/findings</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, 
color, sex, religion, political opinion, national origin, citizenship, 
social origin, disability, age, language, or social status. The law does
 not specifically identify discrimination based on sexual orientation, 
gender identity, HIV-positive status, or other communicable diseases. 
The law prohibits discrimination against domestic workers and prohibits 
any requirement by employers for their domestic workers to wear uniforms
 in public places. The law establishes the following employment quotas 
for persons with disabilities: 3 percent for private businesses with 
more than 50 employees and 5 percent for public-sector organizations. 
The National Council for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities 
oversees compliance with employment quotas for persons with 
disabilities.</p>
<p>The government did not effectively enforce the law. Penalties for 
violations include fines and imprisonment, but they were not sufficient 
to deter violations. NGOs and labor rights advocates noted that 
discrimination cases often went unreported.</p>
<p>Societal prejudice and discrimination led to disproportionately high 
poverty and unemployment rates for women, who earned 30 percent less 
than their male counterparts. Women were more likely than men to work in
 the informal sector, such as in domestic work or as street vendors, 
resulting in lower wages and a lack of benefits. Women were also more 
likely to work in less safe occupations, such as factory work, exposing 
them to more occupational injuries and serious accidents.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for a national minimum wage, which was less 
than the official estimate for the poverty income level. The government 
did not effectively enforce wage laws, and penalties were not sufficient
 to deter violations of minimum wage standards.</p>
<p>The law provides for a 48-hour workweek and one day of rest for 
formal workers. There is no prohibition on excessive compulsory 
overtime, nor does the law limit the amount of overtime that a worker 
may work. The law stipulates 15 days of paid annual vacation.</p>
<p>Occupational safety and health (OSH) standards are appropriate for 
the main industries. SUNAFIL is responsible for the enforcement of OSH 
standards. The government did not effectively enforce the law, as it did
 not devote sufficient resources or personnel to enforce OSH standards 
adequately.</p>
<p>Noncompliance with labor law is punishable by fines. According to a 
labor NGO and labor experts, many fines went uncollected, in part 
because the government lacked an efficient tracking system and at times 
lacked political will.</p>
<p>The law provides for fines and criminal sanctions for OSH violations.
 In cases of infractions, injury, or death of workers or subcontractors,
 the penalty is sufficient to deter violations. Criminal penalties are 
limited to those cases where employers deliberately violated safety and 
health laws and where labor authorities had previously and repeatedly 
notified employers who did not adopt corrective measures. The law 
requires that a worker prove an employerâs culpability before he or she 
can obtain compensation for work-related injuries.</p>
<p>Representatives of labor, business, and the government reported that 
the majority of companies in the formal sector generally complied with 
the law. Many workers in the informal economy, which was approximately 
70 percent of the total labor force, received less than the minimum 
wage. Most informal workers were self-employed. Nearly 90 percent of 
Venezuelan migrant workers were in the informal sector, most of them in 
suboptimal conditions due to their lack of proper documentation and 
inability to validate their academic credentials.</p>
