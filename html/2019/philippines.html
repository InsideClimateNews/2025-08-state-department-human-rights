				<h2 id="report-toc__exec-summary" class="report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

				<p>The Philippines is a multiparty, constitutional republic with a 
bicameral legislature. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, elected in May 
2016, began his constitutionally limited six-year term in June 2016. 
Midterm elections in May for 12 (of 24 total) senators, all 
congressional representatives, and local government leaders were seen as
 generally free and fair, despite reports of violence and vote buying. 
The ruling party and allies won all 12 Senate seats and maintained a 
roughly two-thirds majority in the 306-seat House of Representatives. 
Barangay (village) and youth council elections originally scheduled for 
2021 were rescheduled for December 5, 2022 so that local and national 
elections will occur in the same year.</p>
<p>The Philippine National Police (PNP) is charged with maintaining 
internal security in most of the country and reports to the Department 
of the Interior. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), which 
reports to the Department of National Defense, is responsible for 
external security but also carries out domestic security functions in 
regions with a high incidence of conflict, particularly the Mindanao 
region. The two agencies share responsibility for counterterrorism and 
counterinsurgency operations. The PNP Special Action Force is 
responsible for urban counterterrorism operations. President Duterteâs 
May 2017 declaration of martial law for the entire region of Mindanao 
and the Sulu Archipelago was extended until the end of the year, giving 
the military expanded powers in the area. Governors, mayors, and other 
local officials have considerable influence over local police units, 
including appointment of top departmental and municipal police officers 
and the provision of resources. The government continued to support and 
arm civilian militias. The AFP controlled Civilian Armed Force 
Geographical Units (CAFGUs), while Civilian Volunteer Organizations 
(CVOs) fell under PNP command. These paramilitary units often received 
minimal training and were poorly monitored and regulated. Some political
 families and clan leaders, particularly in Mindanao, maintained private
 armies and, at times, recruited CVO and CAFGU members into those 
armies. Civilian control over security forces was not fully effective.</p>
<p>Significant human rights issues included: unlawful or arbitrary 
killings, including extrajudicial killings, by and on behalf of the 
government and nonstate actors; reports of forced disappearance by and 
on behalf of the government and nonstate actors; torture by and on 
behalf of the government and nonstate actors; arbitrary detention by and
 on behalf of the government and nonstate actors; harsh and 
life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary and unlawful interference 
with privacy; significant problems with the independence of the 
judiciary; the worst forms of restrictions on free expression and the 
press, including violence, threats of violence, and unjustified arrests 
or prosecutions of journalists, censorship, and the existence of 
criminal libel laws; corruption; and unlawful recruitment or use of 
child soldiers by terrorists and groups in rebellion against the 
government.</p>
<p>The government investigated a limited number of reported human rights
 abuses, including abuses by its own forces, paramilitaries, and 
insurgent and terrorist groups. Concerns about police impunity continued
 following the increase in killings by police in 2016. Significant 
concerns also persisted about impunity for the security forces, civilian
 national and local government officials, and powerful business and 
commercial figures. Slow judicial processes remained an obstacle to 
bringing government officials allegedly involved in human rights abuses 
to justice.</p>
<p>Muslim separatists, communist insurgents, and terrorist groups 
continued to attack government security forces and civilians, causing 
displacement of civilians and resulting in the deaths of security force 
members and civilians. Terrorist organizations engaged in kidnappings 
for ransom, bombings of civilian targets, beheadings, and the use of 
child soldiers in combat or auxiliary roles.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were numerous reports government security agencies and 
their informal allies committed arbitrary or unlawful killings in 
connection with the government directed campaign against illegal drugs. 
Killings of activists, judicial officials, local government leaders, and
 journalists by government allies, antigovernment insurgents, and 
unknown assailants also continued. The number of extrajudicial killings 
of all types in the country since 2016 may approach 30,000, according to
 some human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).</p>
<p>The approximately 30,000 antidrug operations conducted from September
 2018 to June 2019 resulted in the deaths of over 600 civilians, 
according to government data. The Central Luzon region emerged as the 
new epicenter for drug-related killings, accounting for 29.6 percent of 
drug-related killings in 2018. Media reported that some police officials
 allegedly involved in previous drug war killings in Metro Manila were 
transferred to Central Luzon, including the former Caloocan City police 
chief, during whose tenure teenager Kian delos Santos was killed in 
2017.</p>
<p>The reported number of extrajudicial killings varied widely, since 
government and NGOs used different definitions. The Commission on Human 
Rights (CHR), an independent government agency responsible for 
investigating possible human rights violations, investigated 914 new 
complaints of alleged extrajudicial or politically motivated killings 
involving 1,098 victims as of August, of which 782 were cases of 
drug-related extrajudicial killings involving 876 victims. The CHR 
suspected PNP or Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency involvement in 550 
of these new complaints and AFP or paramilitary personnel in two cases. 
The CHR attributed the higher number of extrajudicial killing 
investigations in the reporting period to an increase in investigations 
initiated on its own authority based on monitoring news reports, reports
 to the CHR in social media, staffing, or information received following
 CHR outreach efforts.</p>
<p>Killings were not limited to antidrug operations. Media quoted a 
member of congress claiming in June that 134 human rights defenders have
 been killed since President Duterte took office in 2016. In July some 
20 killings on the island of Negros were attributed to political causes.
 Four police died in Ayungon town, allegedly killed by New Peopleâs Army
 rebels. A former leftist mayor also from Ayungon and two other leftist 
politicians from Canlaon City were killed; some alleged they died 
because of their opposition to President Duterte, although no suspects 
have been identified. Legal advocacy groups also expressed concern about
 attacks on judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and other legal professionals,
 alleging that dozens of legal professionals have been killed since the 
beginning of the Duterte administration and documenting lethal attacks 
against eight since January.</p>
<p>There was a widespread belief that police enjoyed impunity for 
killings. Many cases from previous years remained open. Of police 
officers involved in killings in the antidrug war since 2016, only three
 have been convicted of murder, in November 2018 for the 2017 murder of 
juvenile Kian delos Santos.</p>
<p>President Duterte continued his anticrime campaign, specifically 
targeting the trafficking and abuse of illegal narcotics. Fatalities 
fell following a three-month suspension of the campaign in late 2017, 
but increased again beginning in 2018, although at a lower level than 
prior to the suspension, and continued at that level during the year.</p>
<p>Civil society organizations accused police of planting evidence, 
tampering with crime scenes, unlawfully disposing of the bodies of drug 
suspects, and other actions to cover up extrajudicial killings. The CHR 
reported that the PNP refused to share information on investigations 
into police and vigilante killings, as required by the constitution and 
despite a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that the PNP must turn over the 
documents. In May the PNP stated it turned over 95 percent of the 
required records to the solicitor general. Most of the documents, 
however, did not contain information related to drug-related deaths. In 
September the Center for International Law, the legal group representing
 relatives of alleged drug war victims, filed a motion to place the 
Office of Solicitor General and PNP in contempt of court for failing to 
turn over the requested documents.</p>
<p>President Duterte continued to maintain lists of persons he claimed 
were suspected drug criminals, including government, police, military, 
and judicial officials. Many viewed the list as an implied threat, 
particularly as he released the list in the run-up to the May elections.
 Reports suggested the list has grown to include 164 names as of March.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Disappearance</h3>

					
					<p>The AFP Human Rights Office reported no cases of forced 
disappearance attributed to or implicating the AFP from January to July.
 The CHR, however, reported 10 cases of abduction and forced 
disappearance from January to August involving government personnel. In 
June a young man traveling to Lourdes Sur East to attend church failed 
to return home. Family members reported receiving information that he 
was arrested by local officials in the Criminal Investigation and 
Detection Group. His whereabouts as of September remained unknown, and a
 CHR investigation was pending.</p>
<p>Kidnappings during the year were common and predominantly for 
criminal purposes (i.e., ransom); in the past they have been carried out
 for both pro- and anti-government political motives as well. According 
to the PNP, 38 kidnapping cases (55 percent of total cases in 2018) 
occurred in Mindanao, which has been under martial law since 2017. 
Terrorist groups are implicated in many Mindanao kidnappings.</p>
<p>The law allows family members of alleged victims of disappearances to
 compel government agencies to provide statements in court about what 
they know regarding the circumstances surrounding a disappearance (or 
extrajudicial killing) and the victimâs status. Evidence of a kidnapping
 or killing requires the filing of charges, but in many past cases 
evidence and documentation were unavailable or not collected. 
Investigative and judicial action on disappearance cases was 
insufficient; a small number of previously reported cases were 
prosecuted.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law prohibit torture, and evidence obtained
 through its use is inadmissible in court. According to the CHR, 
however, members of the security forces and police were accused of 
routinely abusing and sometimes torturing suspects and detainees. Common
 forms of abuse during arrest and interrogation reportedly included 
electric shock, cigarette burns, and suffocation.</p>
<p>As of August the CHR had investigated 29 cases of alleged torture 
involving 35 victims; it suspected police involvement in 21 of the 
cases. In April three police officers were charged with violating laws 
against torture after beating two civilians in a gaming shop in Cebu, 
recorded in widely viewed closed-circuit television footage.</p>
<p>NGOs and media reported psychological abuse, including shaming 
frequently occurred, especially in alleged drug cases. Under the torture
 statutes, the public parading or shaming of a person is illegal when 
used to undermine a personâs dignity and morale. In an August press 
conference, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno paraded 35 individuals charged with
 drug-related crimes in front of press, thus undermining their rights to
 due process, a presumption of innocence, and privacy. The PNP banned 
the public parading of suspects in June 2018, noting the practice 
violated a personâs human rights.</p>
<p>As part of the antidrug campaign, authorities called on drug 
criminals to turn themselves in to police to avoid more severe 
consequences. As of June, the PNP reported 1,283,409 surrenders 
facilitated since July 2016, with 9,261 of those between June 2018 and 
June 2019. Civil society actors questioned the official figures and 
claimed a climate of fear led many persons associated with drugs to 
surrender.</p>
<p>Human rights groups continued to express concern about abuses 
committed by the PNP and other security forces and noted little progress
 in reforms aimed at improving investigations and prosecutions of 
suspected human rights violations. The AFP Human Rights Office monitored
 and reviewed alleged human rights abuses involving members of the 
military. From January through July, no extrajudicial killings or 
murders, or forced disappearances were identified or investigated by the
 office.</p>
<p>Reports of rape and sexual abuse of women in police or protective 
custody continued. The Center for Womenâs Resources noted that many of 
the rapes occurred in connection with police antidrug operations; 
however, updated data for 2018-19 has yet to be released.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h3>

					
					<p>Prison conditions were often harsh and life threatening and 
included gross overcrowding, inadequate sanitary conditions, physical 
abuse, and a chronic lack of resources including medical care and food.</p>
<p>NGOs reported abuse by prison guards and other inmates were common, 
but they stated that prisoners, fearing retaliation, generally declined 
to lodge formal complaints.</p>
<p>The juvenile justice law exempts minors from criminal liability. Drug
 syndicates often used minors as runners, traffickers, cultivators, or 
drug den employees. Rescued minors are turned over to the custody of 
Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). Police stations had
 youth relations officers to ensure that authorities treated minor 
suspects appropriately, but in some cases they ignored procedural 
safeguards and facilities were not child friendly. The law mandates that
 the Social Welfare Department provide shelter, treatment, and 
rehabilitation services to these children. From January to July, the 
department assisted 1,521 children in conflict with the law (that is, 
alleged as, accused of, or judged as having committed an offense) in 16 
rehabilitation centers (called Bahay Pag-asaâHouses of Hope) nationwide.
 Additionally, several local governments established and managed youth 
centers that provided protection, care, training, and rehabilitation for
 these children and other at-risk youth.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: The Bureau of Corrections (BuCor), under 
the Department of Justice, administered seven prisons and penal farms 
nationwide for individuals sentenced to prison terms exceeding three 
years. BuCor facilities operated at more than three times their 
operating capacity of 12,299, holding 46,272 prisoners. During the year,
 BuCor updated its standards to include a greater distance between 
inmates, resulting in a decrease of operating capacity and nominally 
greater overcrowding.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), under the 
Department of the Interior and Local Government and the PNP, controlled 
512 city, district, municipal, and provincial jails that held pretrial 
detainees, persons awaiting final judgment, and convicts serving 
sentences of three years or less. The BJMP reported its jails operated 
at almost 400 percent over designated capacity. The CHR reported, 
however, that BJMP jails were more than 1,100 percent over capacity. 
Neither calculation met accepted international standards. The Malolos 
city jail, located in a region with one of the highest levels of drug 
war-related arrests and killings, had an official capacity of seven 
inmates, yet as of July held 201 detainees. Likewise, as of September, 
the Manila city jailâs prison guard to prisoner ratio was one guard per 
200 prisoners. Several NGOs and media reports observed that overcrowding
 also contributed to violence among inmates and promoted gang rivalries.</p>
<p>There were 82 female dormitories across all BJMP facilities as of 
July, a net increase of three facilities in 2018 as a result of the 
construction of 29 new jail facilities and the closing of 26 old 
facilities.</p>
<p>As of early 2018 the prison system was one of the most overcrowded in the world. The Birkbeck University of Londonâs <i>World Prison Brief</i>
 noted that in many cases, understaffing led to de facto control of 
prisons by gangs, which imposed disciplinary penalties and provided 
medical care and food.</p>
<p>The Juvenile Justice and Welfare Council, an agency supervised by the
 Department of Justice, reported conditions in youth rehabilitation 
centers were worse than in jails, citing the lack of furniture such as 
beds and cabinets in some centers. For example, the official capacity of
 the Tanglaw Pag-asa Rehabilitation Center in Malolos, Bulacan, was 60, 
but the facility held 144 juveniles with an inadequate food budget of 33
 pesos ($0.65) per head per day. There are 58 Bahay Pag-asa centers in 
the country, 55 run by local government units and three by NGOs.</p>
<p>Prison authorities did not uniformly enforce BJMP and BuCor 
regulations that require holding male and female inmates in separate 
facilities, and, in national prisons, overseeing them with guards of the
 same sex. In some facilities, authorities did not fully segregate 
juveniles from adults. The BJMP and BuCor reported insufficient 
custodial and escort personnel, especially in large jails, with a 
national average of about 57 prisoners assigned to each custodial staff 
member. In larger prisons the ratio was higher; for example in the New 
Bilibid Prison (NBP), one prison guard oversaw 94 prisoners.</p>
<p>Poor sanitation, inadequate ventilation, poor access to natural 
lighting, and a lack of potable water were chronic problems in 
correctional facilities and contributed to health problems. From January
 to July, BuCor and the BJMP reported 914 total inmate deaths. Prison 
authorities reported that most deaths resulted from illness. Authorities
 provided BuCor inmates with medical care; however, some medical 
services and treatments were not available. In such cases, authorities 
referred inmates to an outside hospital. Inmates received a medicine 
allowance of 15 pesos ($0.28) per day. Before the Senate Committee on 
Justice on October 3, NBP Hospital Director Ernesto Tamayo testified 
that approximately 20 percent of prisoners at NBP die annually, 
attributing most deaths to highly infectious diseases such as 
tuberculosis. Following the hearing, BuCorâs Public Information Office 
refuted the directorâs claims, indicating that from January 
2014-September 2019 the prisonâs average mortality rate was about 1.5 
percent. The NBPâs new hospital director as of mid-October, Henry Fabro,
 publicly stated that the mortality rate was 0.5 percent, blaming the 
high figure on the lack of medical personnel and supplies. He stated 
that BuCor employed only 13 doctors nationwide who provide care for 
47,000 prisoners. The BJMPâs medical officer, Paul Borlongan, stated the
 bureau has 12 physicians and two psychiatrists for its 478 facilities. 
The law establishes 1:80 health personnel to inmate ratio as a legal 
requirement.</p>
<p>Juveniles younger than 18 years were typically released by court 
order or following a petition by the Public Attorneyâs Office, the 
inmateâs private lawyer, or through NGO-led appeals. As of July 
juveniles made up less than 1 percent of the prison population.</p>
<p>Opportunities for prisoner recreation, learning, and self-improvement remained scarce.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: Prisoners, their families, and lawyers may 
submit complaints to constitutionally established independent government
 agencies, and the CHR referred complaints it received to the 
appropriate agency.</p>
<p>Authorities generally allowed prisoners and detainees to receive 
visitors, but local NGOs reported that authorities periodically 
restricted family visits for some detainees accused of 
insurgency-related crimes. Prison officials noted that security concerns
 and space limitations at times also restricted prisoner access to 
visitors.</p>
<p>Muslim officials reported that while Muslim detainees were allowed to
 observe their religion, Roman Catholic mass was often broadcast by 
loudspeaker to prison populations of both Roman Catholic and non-Roman 
Catholic prisoners and detainees.</p>
<p><u>Independent </u><u>Monitoring</u>: Authorities permitted 
international monitoring groups, including the International Committee 
of the Red Cross, free and timely access to jails and prisons. The 
constitution grants the CHR authority to visit jails, prisons, or 
detention facilities to monitor the governmentâs compliance with 
international treaty obligations. The CHR reported some detention 
facilities still lacked an understanding of the CHRâs mandate and 
continued to deny their representatives access to detention facilities. 
For example, in 2018 the Caloocan Yakap Center, a youth detention home 
in Metro Manila, required a CHR team to ask the head of the facility for
 permission to monitor compliance by submitting a letter prior to the 
visit.</p>
<p><u>Improvements</u>: To reduce overcrowding, the government began to 
encourage plea bargaining in drug offense cases, resulting in dismissal 
of 20,509 cases.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention and 
provides for the right of persons to challenge the lawfulness of their 
arrest or detention in court, and the government generally observed 
these requirements. As of July the Office of the Ombudsman, an 
independent agency responsible for investigating and prosecuting charges
 of public abuse and impropriety, reported three arbitrary detention 
violations committed by law enforcement agencies or the AFP.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>Warrants based on sufficient evidence and issued by an 
authorized official are required for an arrest unless 1) the suspect is 
observed attempting to commit, in the act of committing, or just after 
committing an offense; 2) there is probable cause based on personal 
knowledge that the suspect just committed an offense; or 3) the suspect 
is an escaped prisoner. Authorities are required to file charges within 
12 to 36 hours for arrests made without warrants, depending on the 
seriousness of the crime. In terrorism cases, the law permits 
warrantless arrests and detention without charges for up to three days.</p>
<p>Detainees have the right to bail, except when held for capital 
offenses or those punishable by a life sentence. The bail system largely
 functioned as intended, and suspects were allowed to appeal a judgeâs 
decision to deny bail. The law provides an accused or detained person 
the right to choose a lawyer and, if the suspect cannot afford one, to 
have the state provide one. An underresourced Public Attorneyâs Office, 
however, limited access of indigent persons to public defenders.</p>
<p><u>Arbitrary Arrest</u>: Security forces continued to detain 
individuals, including juveniles, arbitrarily and without warrants on 
charges other than terrorism, especially in areas of armed conflict. In 
July a journalist filed multiple complaints before the Office of the 
Ombudsman against PNP officials for arbitrary arrest and detention over 
mistaken identity. The complainant linked the arrest to the governmentâs
 targeting of individuals linked to communist rebels.</p>
<p><u>Pretrial Detention</u>: Lengthy pretrial detention remained a 
problem due largely to the slow and ineffectual justice system. 
Approximately 98 percent of prisoners in BJMP/PNP jails were pretrial 
detainees; the balance were convicted criminals serving less than 
three-year sentences. According to the Supreme Court, there were almost 
704,000 pending cases reported by first- and second-level courts 
nationwide, of which approximately 554,000 were criminal cases. Pending 
cases were not evenly distributed among the courts, which resulted in 
some severely overburdened courts. Large jails employed paralegals to 
monitor inmatesâ cases, prevent detention beyond the maximum sentence, 
and assist with decongestion efforts. The BJMP helped expedite court 
cases to promote speedy disposition of inmatesâ cases. Through this 
program, authorities released 53,751 inmates from BJMP jails from 
January to July. Nonetheless, pretrial detention in excess of the 
possible maximum sentence was common, often extending over many years.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for an independent judiciary; although the 
government generally respected judicial independence, pressure, threats,
 and intimidation directed at the judiciary from various sources were 
reported by NGOs during the year. Approximately 40 judicial staff, 
including five judges, have been murdered since 2016. Corruption through
 nepotism, personal connections, and sometimes bribery continued to 
result in relative impunity for wealthy or influential offenders. 
Insufficient personnel, inefficient processes, and long procedural 
delays also hindered the judicial system. These factors contributed to 
widespread skepticism that the criminal justice system delivered due 
process and equal justice.</p>
<p>Trials took place as a series of separate hearings, often months 
apart, as witnesses and court time became available, contributing to 
lengthy delays. There was a widely recognized need for more prosecutors,
 judges, and courtrooms. As of June 30, approximately one-third of 
authorized bench positions (563 positions) were unfilled. Sharia 
(Islamic law) court positions continued to be particularly difficult to 
fill because applicants must be members of both the Sharia Bar and the 
Integrated Bar. The 56 authorized district and circuit Sharia courts do 
not have criminal jurisdiction. Training for sharia court prosecutors 
was brief and considered inadequate.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court continued efforts to provide speedier trials, 
reduce judicial malfeasance, increase judicial branch efficiency, and 
raise public confidence in the judiciary. It continued to implement 
guidelines to accelerate resolution of cases in which the maximum 
penalty would not exceed six years in prison. On August 30, the 
legislature signed Republic Act 11459 into law, creating 150 new 
judge-at-large positions to help ease the backlog of cases.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Trial Procedures</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for the right to a speedy, impartial, 
and public trial. Trials were generally public, but not timely, and 
judicial impartiality was widely questioned. The law requires that all 
persons accused of crimes be informed of the charges against them and 
grants rights to counsel, adequate time to prepare a defense, and a 
speedy and public trial before a judge. No criminal proceeding goes 
forward against a defendant without the presence of a lawyer. The law 
presumes defendants are innocent. They have the right to confront 
witnesses against them, be present at their trial, present evidence in 
their favor, appeal convictions, and not be compelled to testify or 
confess guilt. The court may appoint an interpreter if necessary. If the
 courtâs interpreter makes serious mistakes, a party can challenge the 
interpretation. The government generally implemented these requirements,
 except for the right to a speedy trial.</p>
<p>Although the law provides that cases should be resolved within three 
months to two years, depending on the court, trials effectively had no 
time limits. Government officials estimated it took an average of five 
to six years to obtain a decision. In November 2018 a court found former
 first lady Imelda Marcos guilty of graft from cases dating back to 
1991.</p>
<p>Authorities respected a defendantâs right to representation by a 
lawyer, but poverty often inhibited access to effective legal counsel. 
The Public Attorneyâs Office, which reports to the Department of 
Justice, did not have the necessary resources to fulfill its 
constitutional mandate and used its limited resources to represent 
indigent defendants at trial rather than during arraignments or pretrial
 hearings. During pretrial hearings courts may appoint any lawyer 
present in the courtroom to provide on-the-spot counsel to the accused.</p>
<p>Sentencing decisions were not always consistent with legal guidelines, and judicial decisions sometimes appeared arbitrary.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-9" class="report__section-subtitle">Political Prisoners and Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>Under a 1945 law, the government defines political prisoners as 
those who may be accused of any crime against national security. Using 
this definition, BuCor reported 160 political prisoners in its 
facilities as of June. The BJMP does not track political prisoners and 
defines prisoners based only on security risk.</p>
<p>Various human rights NGOs maintained lists of incarcerated persons 
they considered political prisoners. Task Force Detainees of the 
Philippines, an NGO, tracked political detainees, most of whom were in 
pretrial detention. The task force noted that in the majority of cases, 
authorities mixed political prisoners with the general inmate 
population, except in the New Bilibid Prison, where they held most 
political prisoners in maximum security facilities.</p>
<p>Nearly three years after her arrest, during which prosecutors used a 
variety of legal tactics to delay arraignment, including filing new and 
amending previous charges, opposition Senator Leila de Lima remained in 
police detention on a charge of conspiracy to commit drug trading. In 
February a CHR statement raised concerns about de Limaâs treatment by 
the PNP. Her case began in 2016 after she opened hearings into killings 
related to the antidrug campaign. Although in detention, de Lima had 
access to media and some visitors. Her case attracted widespread 
domestic and international attention, with many observers denouncing the
 charges as politically motivated.</p>
<p>The government permitted regular access to political prisoners by international humanitarian organizations.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-10" class="report__section-subtitle">Civil Judicial Procedures and Remedies</h3>

					
					<p>Most analysts regarded the judiciary as independent in civil 
matters. Complainants have access to local trial courts to seek civil 
damages for, or cessation of, human rights abuses. There are 
administrative as well as judicial remedies for civil complaints, 
although overburdened local courts often dismissed these cases. There 
were no regional human rights tribunals that could hear an appeal from 
the country.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-11" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Arbitrary or Unlawful Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence</h3>

					
					<p>The government generally respected citizensâ privacy, although 
leaders of communist and leftist organizations and rural-based NGOs 
complained of routine surveillance and harassment. Authorities routinely
 relied on informant systems to obtain information on terrorist 
suspects. Regarding the antidrug campaign, the reliability of 
information gained from these sources remained highly questionable. 
Although the government generally respected restrictions on search and 
seizure within private homes, searches without warrants continued. 
Judges generally declared evidence obtained illegally to be 
inadmissible.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-12" class="report__section-subtitle">g. Abuses in Internal Conflicts</h3>

					
					<p>For decades the country has contended with armed Muslim 
separatist movements represented by groups such as the Moro Islamic 
Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front; a communist 
insurgency supported by a nationwide New Peopleâs Army (NPA) presence; 
and violence by smaller, transnational terrorist organizations, such as 
the ISIS-Philippines (ISIS-P), the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), the Maute 
Group, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), and other 
terrorist groups and criminal syndicates. Additionally, interclan <i>rido</i> (feuds) violence continued in Mindanao, causing civilian deaths and displacement.</p>
<p>Martial law in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, imposed after the 
2017 attack on Marawi City by members of the Maute Group, was extended 
again in December 2018 to the end of the year.</p>
<p><u>Killings</u>: NGO Global Witness documented 30 killings of 
environmental and land rights activists in 2018 and alleged security 
force involvement in some of the killings. The AFPâs Human Rights Office
 asserted there were no deaths in 2018 of civilians used by insurgent 
groups as human shields, in contrast to the 44 such deaths reported in 
2017. The AFP, however, attributed 20 civilian deaths to its operations 
during the year.</p>
<p>Antigovernment groups attacked security force units, causing deaths. 
For example, two CAFGU members died when an alleged NPA unit attacked 
their unit in Sallapadan, Abra, northern Luzon on August 15. These 
groups were also responsible for numerous civilian deaths. The NPA, 
ISIS-P, ASG, the Maute Group, Ansar al-Khalifa, the BIFF, and other 
violent extremist groups used roadside bombs, ambushes, suicide 
bombings, and other means to kill political figures and other civilians,
 including persons suspected of being military and police informers. On 
January 27, 20 persons died (and 102 were injured) when two suicide 
attackers detonated explosives during mass in the Roman Catholic 
cathedral in Jolo, Mindanao. The Islamic State claimed responsibility 
for the attacks.</p>
<p>The NPA also menaced government offices and attacked or threatened 
businesses, power stations, farms, and private communication facilities 
to enforce collection of extortion payments, or so-called revolutionary 
taxes.</p>
<p><u>Abductions</u>: Armed criminal and terrorist groups kidnapped 
civilians for ransom. The NPA and some separatist groups were also 
responsible for a number of arbitrary detentions and kidnappings. 
Through unofficial channels, authorities reportedly facilitated ransom 
payments on behalf of victimsâ families and employers. The security 
forces at times attempted to rescue victims. A Dutch man held by the ASG
 in Sulu Province since 2012, died on May 31 during an army-led rescue 
attempt.</p>
<p><u>Physical Abuse, Punishment, and Torture</u>: Leftist and human 
rights activists continued to report harassment by local security 
forces, including abuse of detainees by police and prison officials. 
Rape was not generally used as a weapon of war, but the UN Office of the
 Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed 
Conflict identified three cases of rape by the Maute Group in 2018.</p>
<p><u>Child Soldiers</u>: The use of child soldiers, particularly by 
terrorist and antigovernment organizations, remained a problem, 
especially in some parts of Mindanao affected by low-intensity conflict.
 There was no evidence of use or recruitment of child soldiers by 
government units. In 2018 the UN Office of the Special Representative of
 the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict verified the 
recruitment and use of 19 children by armed groups, including the ASG, 
the BIFF, and the NPA. UNICEF monitored the recruitment and use of 
children in armed conflicts and the release of child soldiers. 
Government reporting mechanisms on child soldiers provided inconsistent 
data across agencies and regions, especially in conflict-affected areas,
 which made it difficult to evaluate the problemâs scale. The NPA 
continued to claim it did not recruit children as combatants but 
admitted that it recruited, trained, and used them for noncombat 
purposes, such as cooking.</p>
<p>In February President Duterte signed into law the Special Protection 
of Children in Situations of Armed Conflict Act, mandating the 
appropriate government agencies to prevent the recruitment of children 
in armed conflict and imposing heavy punishments for violators.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for freedom of speech, including for 
the press, and the government generally respected this right. Government
 harassment of some media outlets occurred, however, and polls suggested
 many Filipinos consider it dangerous to publish information critical of
 the administration.</p>
<p><u>Freedom of </u><u>Expression</u>: Individuals could criticize the 
government publicly or privately and discuss matters of general public 
interest. Civil society organizations, however, said that President 
Duterteâs public attacks on individuals and international bodies who 
criticized his policies had a chilling effect on free speech and 
expression.</p>
<p><u>Press</u><u> and Media</u><u>, Including Online Media</u><b>:</b> 
Media remained active and expressed a wide variety of views without 
restriction, including criticism of the government, despite critical and
 threatening comments from political leadership, including the 
president.</p>
<p>Journalists noted President Duterteâs tendency to single out 
reporters who asked tough questions had a chilling effect on their 
willingness to engage, in large part due to a fear of losing access.</p>
<p>The online news website <i>Rappler</i> was a target of substantial 
pressure, including legal and administrative actions, which some 
observers attributed to its critical coverage of the government. <i>Rappler</i> reporters and provincial correspondents are banned from presidential palace events and press briefings. In April, <i>Rappler</i>
 asked the Supreme Court to declare the coverage ban unconstitutional, 
and in August, 41 journalists from different media organizations joined <i>Rappler</i><i>â</i><i>s</i> petition in the case.</p>
<p>In March, <i>Rappler</i> lost its appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA) against the CAâs ruling that the investment <i>Rappler</i>
 receives from U.S.-based Omidyar Network violated constitutional 
prohibitions on foreign control of a media company. The CA ordered the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reassess the revocation of <i>Rappler</i><i>â</i><i>s</i>
 operating license; the SEC has yet to release the results of its 
review. Rappler Holdings and its president, veteran journalist Maria 
Ressa, were simultaneously facing a number of other court challenges 
stemming from the foreign investment allegation, charges that Human 
Rights Watch called âpolitically motivatedâ and which it described as an
 attempt to muzzle critics of President Duterte and his war on drugs.</p>
<p>On March 28, Ressa was arrested on charges related to the foreign 
financing issue and released later the same day after posting bail, her 
second arrest of the year (see âLibel/Slander Lawsâ below). In October a
 court ordered the suspension of proceedings and remanded one of the 
cases concerning supposed code violations back to city prosecutors 
citing a denial of <i>Rappler</i><i>â</i><i>s</i> due process since the publisher was not initially informed of the alleged violations, thus preventing an appeal.</p>
<p><u>Violence and Harassment</u>: Journalists continued to face 
harassment and threats of violence, including from politicians and 
government authorities critical of their reporting. Human rights NGOs 
frequently criticized the government for failing to protect journalists.
 Government authorities accused members of the National Union of 
Journalists of the Philippines of supporting the communist insurgency, 
claims the organization said were meant to intimidate and silence its 
members.</p>
<p>The Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR), a press 
freedom NGO, reported the Mindanao-based radio broadcaster, Eduardo 
Dizon, was killed on July 10. The broadcasterâs station claimed his 
killing was meant to silence media personalities critical of politicians
 in the region. As of October, CMFR had not determined whether two other
 journalistsâ deaths and another journalistâs shooting during the year 
were related to their work. According to CMFR, as of November a total of
 15 journalists have been killed since President Duterteâs election in 
2016, and Human Rights Watch reported that journalists and media 
personalities noted an increase in online harassment and threats of 
violence in response to articles and comments critical of the government
 since 2016.</p>
<p>In April the presidential palace disseminated a âmatrixâ of 
institutions and individuals allegedly involved in a conspiracy to 
discredit and oust President Duterte ahead of the May midterm elections.
 Among those implicated were journalists from <i>Rappler</i>, Vera 
Files, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism. The 
incident was characterized by human rights NGOs and journalists as an 
attack on press freedom and the presidentâs opponents.</p>
<p>In June a survey from polling company Social Weather Stations showed 
that 51 percent of the countryâs residents agreed with the statement: 
âIt is dangerous to print or broadcast anything critical of the 
administration, even if it is the truth.â Nonetheless, the same survey 
found that 67 percent of the respondents agreed that âmass media in the 
Philippines have freedom of speech, of expression, and of the press.â 
Reporters Without Borders noted the government has found ways to 
pressure journalists who are critical of administration policies.</p>
<p><u>Censorship or Content Restrictions</u>: The law requires broadcast
 franchise renewals be approved by congress; the franchise renewal of 
ABS-CBN, the nationâs most influential broadcast network, has remained 
in limbo since 2016. President Duterte claimed that the station 
collected money for, then did not air, his political advertisements 
during the 2016 election campaign, and he publicly threatened to block 
renewal of the networkâs franchise, which expires in March 2020. 
Although the president later backtracked and said he would not 
intervene, as of October the renewal remained tied up in congress, 
dominated by Duterte allies.</p>
<p><u>Libel</u><u>/Slander Laws</u>: The law contains criminal penalties
 for libel, including, since 2012, for undefined âcyberlibel.â 
Authorities used criminal defamation charges, with the possibility of 
imprisonment and fines, to harass, intimidate, and retaliate against 
journalists. Until February 13, the âcyberlibelâ law had not been tested
 in court. That day the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) filed 
âcyberlibelâ charges against <i>Rappler</i><i>âs</i> CEO Ressa and a <i>Rappler</i>
 journalist. The charge stemmed from a 2017 complaint filed by prominent
 businessman Wilfredo Keng over a 2012 article linking him to human 
trafficking and drug smuggling. The NBI initially rejected the case as 
lacking any legal basis but subsequently recommended that the Department
 of Justice pursue charges against <i>Rappler</i>. Amnesty International
 and Human Rights Watch called the case âpolitically motivatedâ and âan 
assault on media freedom.â On February 13 Ressa was arrested, charged, 
and held overnight before being released on bail. Three days after the 
arrest, the news outlet <i>Philippine Star</i> took down a 2002 online 
article on Keng, reportedly after he âraised the possibility of legal 
action.â The 2002 article was a source for the 2012 <i>Rappler</i> piece. Media groups criticized the <i>Philippine Star</i> for caving to political pressure. In October the court granted <i>Rappler</i><i>â</i><i>s</i>
 request to file a motion for case dismissal based for insufficient 
evidence, but the plea was denied in November, with another hearing set 
for December.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Internet Freedom</h3>

					
					<p>With the exception of mobile communications blocked during 
special events for security purposes, the government did not restrict or
 disrupt access to the internet. While the government did not overtly 
censor online content, there were credible reports of 
government-connected groups using coordinated inauthentic online 
behavior to suppress speech critical of the government. There were no 
credible reports that the government monitored private online 
communication without appropriate legal authority.</p>

					<p>There were no national government restrictions on academic 
freedom or cultural events. But the government suspended the licenses of
 several schools for indigenous Lumad people on Mindanao, in part 
because of alleged failure to comply with curriculum rules (see section 
6, Indigenous People).</p>

					<p>The constitution provides for freedom of internal movement, 
foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the government 
generally respected these rights.</p>
<p><u>For</u><u>eign Travel</u>: Government limits on foreign travel 
were generally based on security or personal safety factors, such as 
when a citizen had a pending court case, or to discourage travel by 
vulnerable workers to countries where they could face personal security 
risks, including trafficking or other exploitation. The Philippine 
Overseas Employment Administration manages departures for work abroad. 
It requires overseas workers to register and receive predeparture 
screening, training, and certification before traveling, and is intended
 to ensure that future overseas workers deal with legitimate, licensed 
recruitment agencies.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Internally Displaced Persons</h3>

					
					<p>Decades of sectarian and political insurgency, sporadic 
interclan fighting, and natural disasters have generated significant 
internal displacement. The number of internally displaced persons (IDPs)
 was uncertain and fluctuated widely. Counterinsurgency campaigns 
against the ASG, primarily in Sulu and Basilan Provinces, and clashes 
with the NPA, concentrated in the most geographically remote provinces, 
caused sporadic and small-scale displacement. Most IDPs were women and 
children.</p>
<p>In Mindanao the UN High Commission for Refugees reported that as of 
June, more than 158,000 persons were displaced and in need of durable 
solutions, most of whom were located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region
 of Muslim Mindanao (the BARMM). Of those, approximately 140,000 were 
displaced by armed conflict, 9,600 by crime or violence, 4,600 by clan 
feuds, and 3,900 by natural disasters.</p>
<p>Government agencies, often with support from UN agencies and other 
international donors, provided food (although NGOs noted food aid was 
sometimes delayed); constructed shelters and public infrastructure; 
repaired schools; built sanitation facilities; offered immunization, 
health, and social services; and provided cash assistance and skills 
training for IDPs. The government permitted humanitarian organizations 
access to IDP sites. Security forces sometimes carried out military 
operations near IDP sites, increasing the risk of casualties and damage 
and restricting freedom of movement. Impoverished IDPs were highly 
susceptible to human trafficking networks. Additionally, despite a 
government policy of free public education, significant numbers of 
children in displaced families were unable to attend school because of 
unofficial school fees and transportation expenses.</p>
<p>At times the government encouraged IDPs to return home, but they were often reluctant to do so for security or welfare reasons.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Protection of Refugees</h3>

					
					<p><u>Access to Asylum</u>: No comprehensive legislation provides 
for granting refugee status or asylum. The Department of Justiceâs 
Refugee and Stateless Persons Protections Unit (RSPPU) determines which 
applicants qualify as refugees in accordance with an established, 
accessible system that appeared to provide basic due process.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-9" class="report__section-subtitle">g. Stateless Persons</h3>

					
					<p>The Department of Justice is responsible for statelessness 
determinations of persons born in the country and of newly arrived 
persons. After an applicant files for a determination of statelessness, 
deportation or exclusion proceedings against the applicant and 
dependents are suspended, and the applicant may be released from 
detention. As of July, eight stateless persons were in the country, 
three of whom were classified as refugees.</p>
<p>Stateless persons may be naturalized. There were no known cases of 
social discrimination against stateless persons or limits on their 
access to public services.</p>
<p>Under the 2014 joint initiative to register persons of Indonesian 
descent at risk of statelessness in Southern Mindanao, the Philippine 
and Indonesian governments collectively registered 8,745 persons. As of 
October, 95 percent of those registered have had their citizenship 
confirmed. The two governments jointly reaffirmed the provision of 
consular assistance to both documented and undocumented migrants of 
Indonesian descent.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides citizens the ability to choose their government
 by secret ballot in free and fair periodic elections based on universal
 and equal suffrage. Candidates, including for the presidency, 
frequently had their legal right to run for office challenged by 
political opponents based on criminality, citizenship, or other 
disqualifying conditions. These cases were sometimes pursued to the 
Supreme Court. Political candidates were allowed to substitute 
placeholders for themselves if unable to complete the registration 
process on time.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-3__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Elections and Political Participation</h3>

					
					<p><u>Recent Elections</u>: The country conducted nationwide 
midterm elections in May for national and local officials. International
 and national observers viewed the elections as well organized and 
generally free and fair, but they noted vote buying continued to be 
widespread and that dynastic political families continued to monopolize 
elective offices. The PNP reported 60 incidents of election-related 
violence that led to 23 killings in the month leading up to the election
 and on election day, a 55 percent drop in violent incidents compared to
 the 2016 national elections. Election officials described the polls as 
relatively peaceful. International Alert, however, reported 144 
election-related incidents in the BARMM alone, mostly fistfights and 
small-scale bombings. President Duterteâs release of his ânarco-listâ as
 a tool to defeat opposition candidates was of uncertain effect, as the 
Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency confirmed that 25 of 46 politicians 
on it won in the midterm polls.</p>
<p>Barangay and youth council elections were held in May 2018. On 
December 3, President Duterte signed into law a bill postponing the next
 barangay and youth council elections, previously scheduled for May 
2020, to December 2022 to align the schedule with national elections.</p>
<p><u>Participation of Women and Minorities</u>: No laws limit 
participation of women or members of minorities in the political 
process, and they did participate. At the national level, women 
comprised nearly 30 percent of the legislature. Participation by these 
groups did not change significantly compared with previous elections.</p>
<p>Men dominated the political scene, although there has been an 
increase in the number of women holding elected positions in government.
 Media commentators expressed concern that political dynasties limited 
opportunities for female candidates not connected to political families.</p>
<p>There were no Muslim or indigenous Senate members, but there were 11 
Muslim members of the House of Representatives, mostly from 
Muslim-majority provinces, and at least three members of indigenous 
descent. Muslims, indigenous groups, and others maintained that electing
 senators from a nationwide list favored established political figures 
from the Manila area.</p>
<p>The law provides for a party-list system, designed to ensure the 
representation of marginalized and underrepresented sectors of society, 
for 20 percent of the seats in the House of Representatives.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-4" class="report__section-title">Section 4. Corruption and Lack of Transparency in Government</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for corruption by public 
officials, but the government did not implement these laws effectively, 
and officials frequently engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. 
Prolonged delays in the justice system reinforced the perception of 
impunity for the security forces and for national, provincial, and local
 government actors accused of corruption and human rights abuses.</p>
<p>President Duterte spoke frequently about his desire to fight 
corruption and fired public officials, including political allies, over 
allegations of corruption. In his July 22 state of the nation address, 
Duterte said his administration had zero tolerance for corruption, 
citing the Bureau of Customs (BOC) as one of the most corrupt government
 agencies. He directed the Office of the Ombudsman to file 
administrative charges against 64 BOC personnel for alleged links to 
corruption.</p>
<p>Human rights groups continued to express concern about the 
contribution of corruption to abuses committed by the PNP and other 
security forces and noted little progress in implementing and enforcing 
reforms aimed at improving investigations and prosecutions of suspected 
human rights violations.</p>
<p>The PNPâs institutional deficiencies and the public perception that 
corruption in the police was endemic continued. The PNPâs Internal 
Affairs Service (IAS) remained largely ineffective. From July 2016 to 
April 2019, senior government officials stated that the PNP received 
14,724 complaints of human rights violations against its officers. Of 
these, the PNP recommended disciplinary procedures in 3,619 cases and 
decided to drop charges in 588 cases. The disposition of the remaining 
cases was unknown. Although the IAS claimed manpower and resource 
limitations hampered its investigations into deaths resulting from 
police operations, it asserted the majority of police operations were 
legitimate, lawful police actions. The PNPâs Counter-Intelligence Task 
Force also monitored police personnel suspected of illegal activities. 
Additionally, as of April the PNP reported that 7,867 police received 
administrative punishments, 4,100 were suspended, and 2,367 were 
dismissed; the number of other punishments including reprimands, 
demotions, forfeiture of wages, and deprivation of privileges was 
unknown.</p>
<p>From January to August, complainants reported 68 cases of alleged 
military and law enforcement involvement in human rights abuses to the 
Office of the Ombudsman, including killings, injuries, unlawful arrest, 
and torture. A majority of the cases were against low-ranking officials.
 As of August all cases remained open pending additional investigation.</p>
<p>Efforts continued to reform and professionalize the PNP through 
improved training, expanded community outreach, and salary increases. 
Human rights modules were included in all PNP career courses, and the 
PNP Human Rights Affairs Office conducted routine training nationwide on
 human rights responsibilities in policing. Several NGOs suggested that 
PNP training courses should have a follow-up mechanism to determine the 
effectiveness of each session.</p>
<p>The AFP Human Rights Office monitored and reviewed alleged human 
rights abuses involving members of the military. From January through 
July, no extrajudicial killings or murders, or forced disappearances 
were identified and investigated by the office.</p>
<p>The military routinely provided human rights training to its members,
 augmented by training from the CHR. Successful completion of these 
courses is required to complete basic training and for induction, 
promotion, reassignment, and selection for foreign schooling 
opportunities. According to AFPâs human rights office, internal human 
rights training is conducted from the general headquarters level down to
 battalion units, totaling hundreds of training exercise annually. From 
January to August, various AFP service units conducted five human 
rights-related training programs, seminars, or workshops with the CHR. 
CHR representatives noted that participants were highly engaged. In 
addition, the International Committee of the Red Cross and NGOs provided
 training throughout the year.</p>
<p>The Congressional Commission on Appointments determines whether 
senior military officers selected for promotion have a history of human 
rights violations and solicits input from the CHR and other agencies 
through background investigations. The commission may withhold a 
promotion indefinitely if it uncovers a record of abuses. Violations, 
however, do not preclude promotion.</p>
<p>Government mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption 
in the security forces were poorly resourced and remained largely 
ineffective. Potential witnesses often were unable to obtain protection.
 The CHR operated a small witness protection program that was 
overburdened by witnesses to killings in the antidrug campaign. The loss
 of family income due to the relocation of a family member was also, in 
some cases, a barrier to witnessesâ testimony. The Office of the 
Ombudsman also reported that witnesses often failed to come forward or 
to cooperate in police abuse or corruption cases. This problem sometimes
 followed pressure on witnesses and their families or arose from an 
expectation of compensation for their cooperation.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: To combat corruption, the constitution establishes
 the independent Office of the Ombudsman, an appellate level 
anticorruption court, and the Commission on Audit. All three 
organizations were underresourced, but they actively collaborated with 
the public and civil society and appeared to operate independently and 
use their limited resources effectively. Despite government efforts to 
file charges and obtain convictions in a number of cases, officials 
continued to engage in corrupt practices with relative impunity.</p>
<p>Between January and July, the Office of the Ombudsman won 334 
convictions in 528 corruption cases. While the total number of cases in 
this period was down only a little over 10 percent, the conviction rate 
fell from just over 75 percent in the same period in 2018 to just over 
63 percent during the year.</p>
<p>In July a former mayor of Tabuk, Kalinga, and his wife were convicted
 and sentenced to between 16 years and 10 months to up to 34 years in 
prison for two counts of direct bribery. In March the governor of Samar 
and two other former provincial staff members were convicted of graft 
and collectively sentenced to 115 years in prison for the âanomalous 
purchaseâ of emergency supplies worth 16.1 million pesos ($301,000) 
following a typhoon in 2001.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: The law requires all public officials 
and employees to file, under oath, a statement of assets, liabilities, 
and net worth (SALN) and to disclose their personal business interests 
and financial connections as well as those of their spouses and 
unmarried children living in their households. Nondisclosure is 
punishable by imprisonment not exceeding five years, a fine not 
exceeding 5,000 pesos ($93.50), or both, and, at the discretion of the 
court, disqualification from holding public office. The Civil Service 
Commission implements and enforces the law, forwarding nondisclosure 
cases to the Office of the Ombudsman for prosecution.</p>
<p>A former BOC deputy commissioner was charged with making false 
statements and with three counts of failing to make certain disclosures 
in his SALN; the falsification charge was withdrawn, he pled guilty to 
the other charges and was removed from office.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A number of domestic and international human rights groups 
operated in the country, investigating and publishing their findings on 
human rights cases. Government officials were under pressure not to 
cooperate or respond to the views of international human rights 
organizations. Local human rights activists continued to encounter 
occasional harassment, mainly from security forces or local officials 
from areas in which incidents under investigation occurred.</p>
<p><u>The United Nations or</u><u> Other International Bodies</u>: In 
March the countryâs withdrawal from the International Criminal Court 
came into effect. This step followed the February 2018 announcement by 
the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) of a 
preliminary examination of potential crimes, including extrajudicial and
 other killings, allegedly committed since July 1, 2016, in the 
governmentâs antidrug campaign. In a March 2018 speech, President 
Duterte ordered security forces not to respond to any probe or 
investigation requests on human rights abuses in the country, and later 
that month the country submitted a formal notification of withdrawal 
from the ICC.</p>
<p><u>Government </u><u>Human Rights </u><u>Bodies</u>: The CHRâs 
constitutional mandate is to protect and promote human rights; 
investigate all human rights violations, including those reported by 
NGOs; and monitor government compliance with international human rights 
treaty obligations. Approximately three-quarters of the countryâs 42,000
 villages had human rights action centers that coordinated with CHR 
regional offices. Although the legislature has doubled the CHRâs budget 
in the last two to three years, despite the executiveâs efforts to 
reduce it, the CHR nonetheless lacked sufficient resources to 
investigate and follow up on all cases presented to its regional and 
subregional offices.</p>
<p>The Office of the Ombudsman is an independent agency that responds to
 complaints about public officials and employees. It has the authority 
to make administrative rulings and seek prosecutions.</p>
<p>The Presidential Human Rights Committee serves as a multiagency 
coordinating body on human rights problems. The committeeâs 
responsibilities include compiling the governmentâs submission for the 
UN Universal Periodic Review. Many NGOs considered it independent but 
with limited ability to influence human rights policy. The committee 
also chairs the Inter-Agency Committee on Extra-Legal Killings, Enforced
 Disappearances, Torture and Other Grave Violations of the Right to 
Life, Liberty and Security of Persons, also known as the AO35 committee.
 This body determines the appropriate mechanisms to resolve cases of 
political violence. It inventories all cases of extrajudicial killings, 
enforced disappearances, torture and other grave violations and 
classifies cases as unresolved, under investigation, under preliminary 
investigation, or under trial.</p>
<p>The Regional Human Rights Commission is a constitutionally mandated 
body tasked with monitoring alleged human rights violations in the 
BARMM.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">Women</h3>

					
					<p><u>Rape and Domestic </u><u>Violence</u>: Rape, including 
spousal rape, is illegal, with penalties ranging from 12 to 40 yearsâ 
imprisonment with pardon or parole possible only after 30 yearsâ 
imprisonment. Conviction can also result in a lifetime ban from 
political office. Penalties for forcible sexual assault range from six 
to 12 yearsâ imprisonment. The law criminalizes physical, sexual, and 
psychological harm or abuse to women and children committed by spouses, 
partners, or parents. Penalties depend on the severity of the crime and 
may include imprisonment or fines.</p>
<p>Authorities generally took reports of rape seriously. NGOs noted that
 in smaller localities perpetrators of abuse sometimes used personal 
relationships with local authorities to avoid prosecution.</p>
<p>Statistics were unavailable on prosecutions, convictions, and 
punishments for cases filed by the PNP. Likewise, difficulty in 
obtaining rape convictions remained a challenge to effective 
enforcement. In the year to August, the PNPâs Women and Children 
Protection Center recorded 944 cases of rape involving female victims, 
of which 463 were filed in courts and 320 referred to prosecutors. The 
rest were either dropped, settled out of court, or dismissed. 
Additionally, BuCor reported 9,737 inmates in its facilities were 
convicted of rape, 213 of these were remanded in custody during the year
 to June.</p>
<p>NGOs reported that because of cultural and social stigmatization, 
many women did not report rape or domestic violence. Reports of rape and
 sexual abuse of women in police or protective custody continued; the 
Center for Womenâs Resources stated that 56 police officers were 
involved in 33 rape cases from July 2016 to October 2018.</p>
<p>Domestic violence against women remained a serious and widespread 
problem. According to the PNP, reported acts of domestic violence 
against women slightly decreased slightly from 11,012 in January to July
 2018 versus 10,976 for the same period during the year.</p>
<p>The PNP and the Social Welfare Department (DSWD) both maintained help
 desks to assist survivors of violence against women and to encourage 
reporting. In addition, the DSWD operated residential centers and 
community-based programs to assist women and children who were victims 
of rape, domestic violence, and other abuse. By the end of the second 
quarter, the DSWD reported it had assisted 194 women and girls who were,
 specifically victims of rape. With the assistance of NGOs, the CHR, and
 the Philippine Commission on Women, law enforcement officers continued 
to receive gender sensitivity training to deal with victims of sexual 
crimes and domestic violence. The PNP maintained a women and childrenâs 
unit in 1,802 police stations throughout the country with 2,009 help 
desks to deal with abuse cases. The PNP assigned 5,482 officers to the 
desks nationwide, almost 98 percent of them women. The law provides 10 
days of paid leave for domestic violence victims.</p>
<p><u>Sexual </u><u>Harassment</u>: The law prohibits sexual harassment,
 and violations are punishable by imprisonment from one to six months, a
 fine of from 10,000 to 20,000 pesos ($187-$374), or both.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment remained widespread and underreported, including in
 the workplace due to victimsâ fear of losing their jobs. A 2016 Social 
Weather Stations study showed that 60 percent of women in Metro Manila 
were harassed at least once in their lifetime.</p>
<p>In July, President Duterte signed the Safe Streets and Public Spaces 
Act to prevent and punish acts of sexual harassment in public places, 
online workplaces, and educational institutions. For example, in October
 a passenger complained of harassment by a driver for an 
application-based ride service. Senator Risa Hontiveros, author of the 
law in the Senate, urged the ride service to investigate and resolve the
 case using the newly signed law. Despite the presidentâs support for 
the new law, the CHR observed that on multiple occasions his rhetoric 
promoted violence against women. For example, speaking at commencement 
ceremonies at the Philippine Military Academy in May, President Duterte 
joked about students raping local women, asked those guilty to identify 
themselves, and then proclaimed a presidential pardon for their crimes.</p>
<p><u>Coercion in Population Control</u>: There were no reports of coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: In law but not always in practice, women have 
most of the rights and protections accorded to men, and the law seeks to
 eliminate discrimination against women. The law accords women the same 
property rights as men. In Muslim and indigenous communities, however, 
property ownership law or tradition grants men more property rights than
 women.</p>
<p>No law mandates nondiscrimination based on gender in hiring, although
 the law prohibits discrimination in employment based on sex. 
Nonetheless, women continued to face discrimination on the job as well 
as in hiring (see section 7.d.).</p>
<p>The law does not provide for divorce. Legal annulments and separation
 are possible, and courts generally recognized divorces obtained in 
other countries if one of the parties was a foreigner. These options, 
however, are costly, complex, and not readily available to the poor. The
 Office of the Solicitor General is required to oppose requests for 
annulment under the constitution. Informal separation is common but 
brings with it potential legal and financial problems. Muslims have the 
right to divorce under Muslim family law.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Children</h3>

					
					<p><u>Birth Registration</u>: Citizenship derives from birth to a 
citizen parent and, in certain circumstances, from birth within the 
countryâs territory to alien parents. The government promoted birth 
registration, and authorities immediately registered births in health 
facilities. Births outside of facilities were less likely to be 
registered promptly, if at all. The Philippine Statistics Authority 
(PSA) estimated that during the year 40 percent of five million 
unregistered residents were children younger than age 14, primarily 
among Muslim and indigenous groups. The DSWD continued working closely 
with local governments to improve registration; the PSA, with support 
from local government units, operated mobile birth registration units to
 reach rural areas. The lack of a birth certificate does not generally 
result in a denial of education or other services, but it may cause 
delays in some circumstances, for example if a minor becomes involved in
 the court system.</p>
<p><u>Education</u>: Education is free and compulsory through age 18, 
but the quality of education was often poor and access difficult, 
especially in rural areas where substandard infrastructure makes 
traveling to school challenging. Supplemental costs, for supplies or 
uniforms, can in some cases be a barrier to students from poor families.
 The Department of Education prioritized improving resources at and 
access to the most isolated schools, to include increasing the budget 
during the year for schools in the BARMM, the region with the lowest 
rate of school attendance.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: Child abuse remained a problem. Through the 
second quarter of the year, the DSWD served 1,827 children in DSWD 
centers and residential care facilities nationwide. Several cities ran 
crisis centers for abused women and children.</p>
<p><u>Early and </u><u>Forced </u><u>Marriage</u>: The legal minimum age
 for marriage for both sexes is 18 years; anyone younger than 21 must 
have parental consent. Under Muslim personal law, Muslim boys may marry 
at 15 and girls may marry when they reach puberty.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: The law prohibits the 
commercial exploitation of children and child pornography and defines 
purchasing commercial sex acts from a child as a trafficking offense. 
The statutory rape law criminalizes sex with minors under 12 and sex 
with a child under 18 involving force, threat, or intimidation. The 
maximum penalty for child rape is 40 years in prison plus a lifetime ban
 from political office. The production, possession, and distribution of 
child pornography are illegal, and penalties range from one month to 
life in prison, plus fines of from 50,000 to five million pesos ($935 to
 $93,500), depending on the gravity of the offense.</p>
<p>While authorities endeavored to enforce the law, inadequate 
prosecutorial resources and capacity to analyze computer evidence were 
challenges to effective enforcement. The government made serious efforts
 to address these crimes and collaborated with foreign law enforcement, 
NGOs, and international organizations. In October the Department of 
Justiceâs Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking partnered with the 
International Justice Mission, the Digital Freedom Network, and others 
to conduct several Prosecuting Online Sexual Exploitation training 
seminars for prosecutors and law enforcement officers on both 
prosecuting cases and obtaining and presenting digital evidence. Alumni 
of this program successfully convicted 33 online sexual exploitation of 
children cases in the year to October.</p>
<p>Despite the penalties, law enforcement agencies and NGOs reported 
that criminals and family members continued to use minors in the 
production of pornography and in cybersex activities. The country 
remained the top global internet source of online child pornography.</p>
<p>Children continued to be victims of sex trafficking and the country 
remained a destination for foreign and domestic child sex tourists. 
Additionally, the live internet broadcast of young Filipino girls, boys,
 and sibling groups performing sex acts for paying foreigners continued.
 The government continued to prosecute accused pedophiles and deport 
those who were foreigners and to stop the entry of identified convicted 
sex offenders. To reduce retraumatization of child victims and spare 
children from having to testify, the government increased its use of 
plea agreements in online child sexual exploitation cases, which 
significantly reduced the case disposition time. In February, for 
example, a woman pled guilty to attempted trafficking in persons, child 
abuse, and possession of child pornography. Acting on a tip, police 
caught the woman offering to sell streaming video of her nine-year-old 
daughter performing sexual acts. The daughter and four other children 
were removed from the home. Using the aforementioned tools, police 
closed the case in three months without retraumatizing the children.</p>
<p>The NBI and the PNP worked closely with the labor department to 
target and close facilities suspected of sex trafficking of minors. From
 January to June, DSWD data reported 29 cases in which children were 
victims of sex trafficking and 13 cases of child pornography.</p>
<p><u>Displaced Children</u>: While there were no recent, reliable data,
 involved agencies and organizations agreed there were hundreds of 
thousands of street children in the country. The problem was endemic 
nationwide, and encompassed local children and the children of IDPs, 
asylum seekers, and refugees. Many street children were involved in 
begging, garbage scavenging, and petty crime.</p>
<p>Service agencies, including the DSWD, provided residential and 
community-based services to thousands of street children nationwide, 
including in a limited number of residential facilities and the growing 
Comprehensive Program for Street Children, Street Families, and 
Indigenous Peoples. This program included activity centers, education 
and livelihood aid, and community service programs.</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is a party to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs <i>Annual Report</i><i> on </i><i>International Parental Child Abduction</i> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200614220534/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data/reported-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Persons with Disabilities</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution prohibits discrimination against persons with 
physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities. The law aims 
to provide affordable and accessible mental health services and provide 
for equal access for persons with disabilities to all public buildings 
and establishments.</p>
<p>The National Council for Disability Affairs formulated policies and 
coordinated the activities of government agencies for the 
rehabilitation, self-development, and self-reliance of persons with 
disabilities and their integration into the mainstream of society.</p>
<p>The law was not effectively enforced, and many barriers remained for 
persons with disabilities. Advocates for persons with disabilities 
contended that equal access laws were ineffective due to weak 
implementing regulations, insufficient funding, and inadequately focused
 integrative government programs. The great majority of public buildings
 remained inaccessible to persons with physical disabilities. Many 
schools had architectural barriers that made attendance difficult for 
persons with disabilities. Government efforts to improve access to 
transportation for persons with disabilities were limited.</p>
<p>Persons with disabilities continued to face discrimination and other challenges in finding employment (see section 7.d.).</p>
<p>Some children with disabilities attended schools in mainstream or 
inclusive educational settings. The Department of Educationâs 648 
separate education centers did not provide nationwide coverage, and the 
government lacked a clear system for informing parents of children with 
disabilities of their educational rights and did not have a well-defined
 procedure for reporting discrimination in education.</p>
<p>From January to August, the DSWD provided services to 1,492 persons 
with disabilities in assisted living centers and community-based 
vocational centers nationwide, significantly fewer than reported in 
2018. The DSWD attributed the lower figures to its community-based 
centers providing only partial data to date. If a person with 
disabilities suffered violence, access to after-care services was 
available through the DSWD, crisis centers, and NGOs. Of local 
government units, 60 percent had a Persons with Disability Office to 
assist in accessing services including health, rehabilitation, and 
education.</p>
<p>The constitution provides for the right of persons with physical 
disabilities to vote. The Commission on Elections determines the 
capacity of persons with mental disabilities to vote during the 
registration process, and citizens may appeal exclusions and inclusions 
in court. A federal act authorizes the commission to establish 
accessible voting centers exclusively for persons with disabilities and 
senior citizens.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Indigenous People</h3>

					
					<p>Although no specific laws discriminate against indigenous 
people, the geographical remoteness of the areas many inhabit and 
cultural bias prevented their full integration into society. Indigenous 
children often suffered from lack of health care, education, and other 
basic services. Government officials indicated approximately 80 percent 
of the countryâs government units complied with the longstanding legal 
requirement that indigenous peoples be represented in policy-making 
bodies and local legislative councils. The National Commission on 
Indigenous Peoples in September stated that at the barangay level in 
Cordillera Province only half of the local councils were in compliance 
with the law.</p>
<p>In October the Department of Education officially ordered the closure
 of 55 schools for Lumad children operated by the NGO Salugpongan in the
 Davao region for alleged deviations from the basic curriculum, teaching
 antigovernment ideologies, and providing instruction in the use of 
weapons and guerilla tactics. The allegations were formally set out in a
 report by the Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, set up 
by President Duterte in December 2018. Duterte had himself previously 
leveled the same charges and threatened to bomb the schools. Some Lumad 
leaders had also previously called for the closure of the schools for 
serving as recruitment centers for the NPA. Critics argued, however, 
that the reportâs findings were based on unsubstantiated testimony from a
 single witness, a former student. Lumad students were reassigned to 
local public schools. The Save Our Schools network of civic groups said 
the step was unjustified and taken at the behest of the AFP, which 
largely sees the Lumads as allies of the NPA.</p>
<p>The National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, a government agency 
staffed by tribal members, was responsible for implementing 
constitutional provisions to protect indigenous peoples. It has 
authority to award certificates identifying âancestral domain landsâ 
based on communal ownership, thereby stopping tribal leaders from 
selling the land.</p>
<p>Armed groups frequently recruited from indigenous populations. 
Indigenous peoplesâ lands were also often the site of armed encounters 
related to resource extraction or intertribal disputes, which sometimes 
resulted in displacement or killings. In an August Senate Cultural 
Communities Committee hearing, three indigenous persons testified about 
their involvement with the NPA.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h3>

					
					<p>National laws neither criminalize consensual same-sex sexual 
conduct among adults nor prohibit discrimination based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity. Eighteen cities, six provinces, three 
barangays, and one municipality have enacted a version of an 
antidiscrimination ordinance that protects lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
transgenderâbut not intersexârights.</p>
<p>Officials prohibit transgender individuals from obtaining passports 
that reflect their gender identity. Authorities print the gender at 
birth, as reported on the birth certificate, in the individualâs 
passport, which posed difficulty for transgender persons seeking to 
travel, including instances of transgender individuals denied boarding.</p>
<p>NGOs reported incidents of discrimination and abuse against lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons, including in 
employment (see section 7.d.), education, health care, housing, and 
social services. In August custodial staff denied a transgender woman 
access to the womenâs restroom at a mall in Quezon City, the first 
municipality in the country to adopt an antidiscrimination ordinance. 
The transgender woman recorded the incident. After public backlash, 
Quezon City mayor Joy Belmonte condemned the incident and ordered a 
check of the mallâs compliance with the cityâs ordinance requiring 
âall-genderâ toilets in both public and private establishments.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the rights of workers, with the exception 
of the military, police, short-term contract employees, and some foreign
 workers, to form and join independent unions, bargain collectively, and
 conduct strikes; it prohibits antiunion discrimination. The law, 
however, places several restrictions on these rights.</p>
<p>Laws and regulations provide for the right to organize and bargain 
collectively in both the private sector and corporations owned or 
controlled by the government. The law prohibits organizing by foreign 
national or migrant workers unless a reciprocity agreement exists with 
the workersâ countries of origin specifying that migrant workers from 
the Philippines are permitted to organize unions there. The law also 
bars temporary or outsourced workers and workers without employment 
contracts from joining a union. The law requires the participation of 20
 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit where the union seeks 
to operate; the International Labor Organization (ILO) called this 
requirement excessive. The scope of collective bargaining in the public 
sector is limited to a list of terms and conditions of employment 
negotiable between management and public employees. These are items 
requiring appropriation of funds, including health care and retirement 
benefits, and those that involve the exercise of management 
prerogatives, including appointment, promotion, compensation structure, 
and disciplinary action, are nonnegotiable.</p>
<p>Strikes in the private sector are legal. Unions are required to 
provide advance strike notice (30 days for issues associated with 
collective bargaining and 15 days for issues regarding unfair labor 
practices), respect mandatory cooling-off periods, and obtain approval 
from a majority of members before calling a strike. The Department of 
Labor and Employmentâs (DOLE/labor department) National Conciliation and
 Mediation Board reported 580 mediation-conciliation cases from January 
to September. Of these, 398 cases were filed under preventive mediation,
 165 under notices of strike or lockout, 13 cases under actual strike or
 lockout, and four wildcat strikes or strikes without notice. The number
 of wildcat strikes increased from one to four during the year, mostly 
dealing with contractualization and regularization issues.</p>
<p>The law subjects all problems affecting labor and employment to 
mandatory mediation-conciliation for one month. The labor department 
provides mediation services through a board, which settles most unfair 
labor practice disputes. Through the National Conciliation and Mediation
 Board, the department also works to improve the functioning of 
labor-management councils in companies with unions.</p>
<p>If mediation fails, the union may issue a strike notice. Parties may 
bring any dispute to mediation, but strikes or lockouts must be related 
to acts of unfair labor practice, a gross violation of collective 
bargaining laws, or a collective bargaining deadlock. The law provides 
for a maximum prison sentence of three years for participation in an 
illegal strike, although there has never been such a conviction. The law
 also permits employers to dismiss union officers who knowingly 
participate in an illegal strike.</p>
<p>The law prohibits government workers from joining strikes under the 
threat of automatic dismissal. Government workers may file complaints 
with the Civil Service Commission, which handles administrative cases 
and arbitrates disputes. Government workers may also assemble and 
express their grievances on the work premises during nonworking hours.</p>
<p>The secretary of the DOLE, and in certain cases the president, may 
intervene in labor disputes by assuming jurisdiction and mandating a 
settlement if either official determines that the strike-affected 
company is vital to the national interest. Vital sectors include 
hospitals, the electric power industry, water supply services (excluding
 small bottle suppliers), air traffic control, and other activities or 
industries as recommended by the National Tripartite Industrial Peace 
Council (NTIPC). Labor rights advocates continued to criticize the 
government for maintaining definitions of vital services that were 
broader than international standards.</p>
<p>By law antiunion discrimination, especially in hiring, is an unfair 
labor practice and may carry criminal or civil penalties (although 
generally civil penalties were favored over criminal penalties).</p>
<p>In most cases, the government respected freedom of association and 
collective bargaining and enforced laws protecting these rights. The 
Department of Labor has general authority to enforce laws on freedom of 
association and collective bargaining. The National Labor Relations 
Commissionâs (NLRC) labor arbiter may also issue orders or writs of 
execution for reinstatement that go into effect immediately, requiring 
employers to reinstate the worker and report compliance to the NLRC. 
Allegations of intimidation and discrimination in connection with union 
activities are grounds for review by the quasijudicial NLRC, as they may
 constitute possible unfair labor practices. If there is a definite 
preliminary finding that a termination may cause a serious labor dispute
 or mass layoff, the DOLE secretary may suspend the termination and 
restore the status quo pending resolution of the case.</p>
<p>Penalties under the law for violations of freedom of association or 
collective bargaining laws were generally not sufficient to deter 
violations. Administrative and judicial procedures were subject to 
lengthy delays and appeals.</p>
<p>The NTIPC serves as the main consultative and advisory mechanism on 
labor and employment for organized labor, employers, and government on 
the formulation and implementation of labor and employment policies. It 
also acts as the central entity for monitoring recommendations and 
ratifications of ILO conventions. The labor department, through the 
NTIPC, is responsible for coordinating the investigation, prosecution, 
and resolution of cases alleging violence and harassment of labor 
leaders and trade union activists pending before the ILO.</p>
<p>Workers faced several challenges in exercising their rights to 
freedom of association and collective bargaining. Some employers 
reportedly chose to employ workers who could not legally organize, such 
as short-term contract and foreign national workers, to minimize 
unionization and avoid other rights accorded to âregularâ workers. The 
nongovernmental Center for Trade Union and Human Rights contended that 
this practice led to a decline in the number of unions and workers 
covered by collective bargaining agreements. In August the president 
vetoed a proposed law that would have converted many of these temporary 
workers into regular workers. Employers also often abused contractual 
labor provisions by rehiring employees shortly after the expiration of 
the previous contract. The labor department reported multiple cases of 
workers alleging employers refused to bargain.</p>
<p>Unions continued to claim that local political leaders and officials 
who governed the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) explicitly attempted to 
frustrate union organizing efforts by maintaining union-free or 
strike-free policies. Unions also claimed the government stationed 
security forces near industrial areas or SEZs to intimidate workers 
attempting to organize and alleged that companies in SEZs used frivolous
 lawsuits to harass union leaders. Local SEZ directors claimed exclusive
 authority to conduct their own inspections as part of the zonesâ 
privileges intended by the legislature. Employers controlled hiring 
through special SEZ labor centers. For these reasons, and in part due to
 organizersâ restricted access to the closely guarded zones and the 
propensity among zone establishments to adopt fixed term, casual, 
temporary, or seasonal employment contracts, unions had little success 
organizing in the SEZs. The DOLE does not have data on compliance with 
labor standards in SEZs.</p>
<p>In June the ILO noted that numerous cases of trade union murders and 
other acts of violence remained for which the presumed perpetrators have
 yet to have been identified and the guilty parties punished, even 
several years after the incidents.</p>
<p>In February union activists said that Pulido Apparel Company claimed 
financial difficulties to justify dismissing most of its workforce and 
then reopened and refused to hire workers with union ties.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor. Legal
 penalties are sufficient to deter violations. The government did not 
effectively enforce the law.</p>
<p>Trade unions reported continued poor compliance with the law, due in 
part to the governmentâs lack of capacity to inspect labor practices in 
the informal economy. The government continued awareness-raising 
activities, especially in the provinces, in an effort to prevent forced 
labor. The DOLEâs efforts included an orientation program for recruits 
for commercial fishing vessels, who were among the workers most 
vulnerable to forced labor conditions.</p>
<p>Reports of forced labor by adults and children continued, mainly in 
fishing and other maritime industries, small-scale factories, gold 
mines, domestic service, agriculture, and other areas of the informal 
sector (see section 7.c.). Unscrupulous employers subjected women from 
rural communities and impoverished urban centers to domestic servitude, 
forced begging, and forced labor in small factories. They also subjected
 men to forced labor and debt bondage in agriculture, including on sugar
 cane plantations and in fishing and other maritime industries.</p>
<p>There were reports some persons who voluntarily surrendered to police
 and local government units in the violent antidrug campaign were forced
 to do manual labor or other activities that could amount to forced 
labor without charge, trial, or finding of guilt under law.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits employing children younger than age 15, 
including for domestic service, except under the direct and sole 
responsibility of parents or guardians, and sets the maximum number of 
working hours for them at four hours per day and no more than 20 hours 
per week. The law also prohibits the worst forms of child labor. 
Children between 15 and 17 are limited to eight working hours per day, 
up to a maximum of 40 hours per week. The law forbids the employment of 
persons younger than 18 in hazardous work. The minimum age for work is 
lower than the compulsory education age, enticing some children to leave
 school before the completion of their compulsory education.</p>
<p>Although the government imposed fines and instituted criminal 
prosecutions for law violations in the formal sector, such as in 
manufacturing, it did not effectively enforce the law consistently. 
Fines for child labor law violations were not sufficient to deter 
violations. From January to July, the DOLE, through its Sagip Batang 
Manggagawa (Rescue Child Laborers) program (part of the Health, 
Education, Livelihood, and Prevention, Protection, and Prosecution, 
Monitoring and Evaluation [H.E.L.P.M.E.] Convergence Program), conducted
 five operations and removed nine minors from hazardous and exploitative
 working conditions. As of July, the department closed four 
establishments for violations of child labor laws.</p>
<p>The government, in coordination with domestic NGOs and international 
organizations, continued to implement programs to develop safer options 
for children, return them to school, and offer families viable economic 
alternatives to child labor. The labor department continued its efforts 
to reduce the worst forms of child labor and to remove children from 
hazardous work under the H.E.L.P.M.E. Convergence Program. Additionally,
 in September an executive order created the National Council Against 
Child Labor, mandating it to fully implement existing child protection 
laws.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, child labor remained a widespread problem. 
Previous cases reported to the DOLE centered in the service and 
agricultural sectors, notably in the fishing, palm oil, and sugar cane 
industries. Most child labor occurred in the informal economy, often in 
family settings. Child workers in those sectors and in activities such 
as gold mining, manufacturing (including of fireworks), domestic 
service, drug trafficking, and garbage scavenging faced exposure to 
hazardous working environments. In 2018 the DOLE issued two 
administrative orders related to child labor. One order harmonized the 
process of removing children from child labor, referring them to the 
appropriate agency, and assisting them with all necessary service(s) and
 intervention. The other created the Task Force Against Illegal 
Recruitment, Recruitment of Minor Workers, and Trafficking in Persons.</p>
<p>NGOs and government officials continued to report cases in which 
family members sold children to employers for domestic labor or sexual 
exploitation.</p>
<p>Online sexual exploitation of children and child soldiering also 
continued to be a problem (see sections 6 and 1.g., respectively).</p>
<p>Also see the Department of Laborâs <i>Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor</i> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200614220534/https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/findings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/findings</a>.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination with respect to employment and 
occupation based on age, sex, race, creed, disability, HIV, 
tuberculosis, hepatitis B, or marital status. The law does not prohibit 
employment discrimination with respect to color, political opinion, 
national origin or citizenship, language, sexual orientation, gender 
identity, age, other communicable disease status, or social origin. 
While some local antidiscrimination ordinances exist at the municipal or
 city levels that prohibit employment discrimination against lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, and transgenderâbut not intersexâpersons, there was no 
prohibition against such discrimination in national legislation.</p>
<p>The law requires most government agencies and government-owned 
corporations to reserve 1 percent of their positions for persons with 
disabilities; government agencies engaged in social development must 
reserve 5 percent. The law commits the government to providing 
âsheltered employmentâ to persons with disabilities, for example in 
workshops providing separate facilities. The labor departmentâs Bureau 
of Local Employment maintained registers of persons with disabilities 
that indicate their skills and abilities and promote the establishment 
of cooperatives and self-employment projects for such persons.</p>
<p>Persons with disabilities experienced discrimination in hiring and 
employment. The labor department estimated that only 10 percent of 
employable persons with disabilities were able to find work.</p>
<p>Between January and July, no cases were filed to enforce the law. The
 government did not effectively monitor laws prohibiting employment 
discrimination or regarding the employment of persons with disabilities.
 The effectiveness of penalties to prevent violations could not be 
assessed.</p>
<p>The government had limited means to assist persons with disabilities 
in finding employment, and the cost of filing a lawsuit and lack of 
effective administrative means of redress limited the recourse of such 
persons when prospective employers violated their rights. In 2016 an 
HIV-positive worker won a case against his employer for having been 
fired because of his HIV-positive diagnosis. The court ordered that the 
individual be reinstated and receive approximately 600,000 pesos 
($11,200) in damages and back wages.</p>
<p>Discrimination in employment and occupation against LGBTI persons 
occurred; a number of LGBTI organizations submitted anecdotal reports of
 discriminatory practices that affected the employment of LGBTI persons.
 Discrimination cases included the enforcement of rules, policies, and 
regulations that disadvantaged LGBTI persons in the workplace. For 
example, in June a transgendered professor at the University of the 
Philippines disclosed that the reviewing committee denied her tenure 
application by citing both professional and interpersonal concerns. She 
believes her denial was due, in part, to her being transgender.</p>
<p>Women faced discrimination both in hiring and on the job. Some labor 
unions claimed female employees suffered punitive action when they 
became pregnant. Although women faced workplace discrimination, they 
continued to occupy positions at all levels of the workforce.</p>
<p>Women and men were subject to systematic age discrimination, most notably in hiring.</p>
<p>The government allowed refugees to work. A DOLE order affirmed 
refugeesâ and stateless personsâ access to work permits. The Bureau of 
Immigration provided temporary work permits for persons with pending 
applications for refugee or stateless status upon endorsement by the 
RSPPU. The types of employment open to refugees and stateless persons 
were generally the same as those open to other legal aliens.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>As of May, tripartite regional wage boards of the National Wage 
and Productivity Commission had not increased the daily minimum wage 
rates for agricultural and nonagricultural workers. Minimum wages were 
below the poverty line.</p>
<p>The law did not cover many workers, since wage boards exempted some 
newly established companies and other employers from the rules because 
of factors such as business size, industry sector, export intensity, 
financial distress, and capitalization level.</p>
<p>Domestic workers worked under a separate wage and benefit system, 
which lays out minimum wage requirements and payments into social 
welfare programs, and mandates one day off a week. While there were no 
reliable recent data, informed observers believed two million or more 
persons were employed as domestic workers, with nearly 85 percent being 
women or girls as young as 15 years old.</p>
<p>Penalties for noncompliance with increases or adjustments in the wage
 rates as prescribed by law are a fine not exceeding 25,000 pesos 
($467), imprisonment of one to two years, or both. In addition to fines,
 the government used administrative procedures and moral persuasion to 
encourage employers to rectify violations voluntarily. The penalties 
were not sufficient to deter violations. The government did not 
effectively enforce minimum wage or occupational safety and health laws.</p>
<p>By law the standard work week is 48 hours for most categories of 
industrial workers and 40 hours for government workers, with an eight 
hour per day limit. The law mandates one day of rest each week. The 
government mandates an overtime rate of 125 percent of the hourly rate 
on ordinary days, 130 percent on special nonworking days, and 200 
percent on regular holidays. There is no legal limit on the number of 
overtime hours that an employer may require.</p>
<p>The law provides for a comprehensive set of occupational safety and 
health standards. Regulations for small-scale mining prohibit certain 
harmful practices, including the use of mercury and underwater, or 
compressor, mining. The law provides for the right of workers to remove 
themselves from situations that endangered health or safety without 
jeopardy to their employment. Most labor laws apply to foreign workers, 
who must obtain work permits and may not engage in certain occupations.</p>
<p>The DOLEâs Bureau of Working Conditions (BWC) monitors and inspects 
compliance with labor law in all sectors, including workers in the 
formal and informal sectors, nontraditional laborers, as well as 
inspects SEZs and businesses located there. The number of labor law 
compliance officers, who monitor and enforce the law, including by 
inspecting compliance with core labor and occupational safety standards 
and minimum wages, was insufficient for the workforce of 42 million, 
particularly in rural areas. ILO standards for developing countries 
suggest a need for approximately 2,800 labor inspectorsâone inspector 
for every 15,000 workers. The labor department prioritized increasing 
the number of officers while acknowledging that insufficient inspection 
funds continued to impede its ability to investigate labor law 
violations effectively, especially in the informal sector and in small- 
and medium-size enterprises.</p>
<p>The DOLE continued to implement its Labor Laws Compliance System for 
the private sector. The system included joint assessments, compliance 
visits, and occupational safety and health standards investigations. 
Labor department inspectors conducted joint assessments with employer 
and worker representatives; inspectors also conducted compliance visits 
and occupational safety and health standards investigations. The labor 
department and the ILO also continued to implement an information 
management system to capture and transmit data from the field in real 
time using mobile technology. Violations from January to July included 
10,950 for general labor standards, 4,480 for violations of minimum wage
 rates, and 20,585 for occupational safety and health standards. 
Following a deficiency finding, the labor department may issue 
compliance orders that can include a fine or, if the deficiency poses a 
grave and imminent danger to workers, suspend operations. DOLE-BWC 
closed six establishments, rescuing 13 minors, for child labor 
violations as of July.</p>
<p>During the year various labor groups criticized the governmentâs 
enforcement efforts, in particular the DOLEâs lax monitoring of 
occupational safety and health standards in workplaces. Between January 
and July, the BWC recorded 27 work-related accidents that caused 26 
deaths and 35 injuries. Statistics on work-related accidents and 
illnesses were incomplete, as incidents were underreported, especially 
in agriculture.</p>
<p>Violations of minimum wage standards were common. Many firms hired 
employees for less than minimum wage apprentice rates, even if there was
 no approved training in their work. Complaints about payment under the 
minimum wage and nonpayment of social security contributions and bonuses
 were particularly common at companies in the SEZs.</p>
<p>A DOLE order sets guidelines on the use of labor contracting and 
subcontracting. Some labor unions, however, criticized the order for not
 ending all forms of contractual work. On July 26, President Duterte 
vetoed the Security of Tenure Bill, which would have added limits to the
 use of contract workers, and requested another version of the bill from
 the Senate and House of Representatives to be filed. The DOLE is also 
filing its own version.</p>
<p>There were also gaps and uneven applications of the law. Media 
reported problems in the implementation and enforcement of the domestic 
workerâs law, including a tedious registration process, an additional 
financial burden on employers, and difficulty in monitoring employer 
compliance.</p>
<p>The government and several NGOs worked to protect the rights of the 
countryâs overseas citizens, most of whom were Philippine Overseas 
Employment Agency (POEA) contract or temporary workers. Although the 
POEA registered and supervised domestic recruiter practices, authorities
 often lacked sufficient resources to provide complete worker protection
 overseas. The Overseas Worker Welfare Administration provides support 
to overseas workers in filing grievances against employers via its Legal
 Assistance Fund. The fund covers administrative costs that would 
otherwise prevent overseas workers from filing grievance complaints. 
Covered costs include fees for court typing and translation, visa 
cancellation, and contract termination.</p>
<p>The government continued to place financial sanctions on, and bring 
criminal charges against, domestic recruiting agencies found guilty of 
unfair labor practices. From January to July, the POEA reported the 
closure of four unlicensed companies.</p>
