				<h2 id="report-toc__exec-summary" class="report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

				<p>Romania is a constitutional republic with a democratic, 
multiparty parliamentary system. The bicameral parliament consists of 
the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, both elected by popular vote. 
Observers considered presidential elections held on November 10 and 24 
and parliamentary elections in 2016 to have been generally free and fair
 and without significant irregularities.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs is responsible for the General 
Inspectorate of the Romanian Police, the gendarmerie, border police, the
 General Directorate for Internal Protection (DGPI), and the Directorate
 General for Anticorruption (DGA). The DGPI has responsibility for 
intelligence gathering, counterintelligence, and preventing and 
combatting vulnerabilities and risks that could seriously disrupt public
 order or target Ministry of Internal Affairs operations. The minister 
of interior appoints the head of DGPI. The Romanian Intelligence Service
 (SRI), the domestic security agency, investigates terrorism and 
national security threats. The president nominates and the parliament 
confirms the SRI director. Civilian authorities maintained effective 
control over SRI and the security agencies that reported to the Ministry
 of Internal Affairs.</p>
<p>Significant human rights issues included: police violence against 
Roma; endemic official corruption; law enforcement authorities condoning
 violence against women and girls; and abuse against institutionalized 
persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>The judiciary took steps to prosecute and punish officials who 
committed abuses, but authorities did not have effective mechanisms to 
do so and delayed proceedings involving alleged police abuse and 
corruption, with the result that many of the cases ended in acquittals. 
Impunity for perpetrators of human rights abuses was a continuing 
problem.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were reports that the government or its agents committed 
arbitrary or unlawful killings. On July 19, in the city of Vatra Dornei,
 three gendarmes tried for 10 minutes to immobilize physically a 
55-year-old man suspected of inappropriately touching a child and used 
tear gas spray against him. During the intervention, the man became 
unconscious and was taken to the hospital, where he died the following 
day. The Prosecutorâs Office attached to the Iasi Military Tribunal 
started an investigation of the case, including the prosecution of a 
member of the gendarmerie for abusive behavior and abuse of power.</p>
<p>The Institute for Investigating Communist Crimes and the Memory of 
the Romanian Exile (IICCMRE) was authorized to submit criminal 
complaints related to alleged communist-era crimes. In June 2018 the 
IICCMRE submitted a criminal complaint to the Prosecutorâs Office on 
alleged inhuman treatment between 1980 and 1989 in the Siret 
Neuropsychological Pediatric Hospital that resulted in 340 deaths.</p>
<p>In 2017 the trial began of former communist-era Securitate officials 
Marin Parvulescu, Vasile Hodis, and Tudor Postelnicu, accused of crimes 
against humanity before the Bucharest Court of Appeals. They were 
charged in the death of dissident Gheorghe Ursu, who was arrested and 
allegedly beaten to death by investigators and cellmates in 1985. In 
October the Bucharest Court of Appeals issued a nonfinal ruling 
acquitting Parvulescu and Hodis. Gheorghe Ursuâs son announced he would 
challenge the decision before the High Court of Cassation and Justice.</p>
<p>In 2016 the Military Prosecutorâs Office indicted former president 
Ion Iliescu, former prime minister Petre Roman, former vice prime 
minister Gelu Voican Voiculescu, and former Intelligence Service 
director Virgil Magureanu for crimes against humanity. They were accused
 of involvement in the 1990 âminersâ riot,â when thousands of miners 
were brought to Bucharest to attack demonstrators opposed to Iliescuâs 
rule. According to official figures, the violence resulted in hundreds 
of injuries, illegal arrests, and four deaths. Media estimates of the 
number injuries and deaths were much higher. Prosecutors opened the 
preliminary phase of the case before the High Court of Cassation and 
Justice on November 29, where it remained underway.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law prohibit such practices, but there were
 reports from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and media that police
 and gendarmes mistreated and abused prisoners, pretrial detainees, 
Roma, and other vulnerable persons, including homeless persons, women, 
sex workers, and substance abusers, primarily with excessive force, 
including beatings. For example, journalists alleged that in September 
2018 four agents of the Bucharest Sector 3 police used excessive force 
against two Romani teenagers caught fishing in a public park. As of 
September the Prosecutorâs Office attached to the Bucharest Sector 3 
court was investigating the case.</p>
<p>In February prosecutors in Bucharest Sector 5 opened a case against 
15 employees and the director of the Rahova Penitentiary Hospital for 
allegedly beating several inmates between 2015 and 2018 and falsifying 
medical records to cover up the abuses. As of September the 
investigation of 16 defendants and seven suspects remained pending.</p>
<p>The NGO Romani Center for Social Intervention and Studies (Romani 
CRISS) stated that in 44 cases of police brutality against Roma over the
 previous 13 years, there were no convictions at the national level, 
often because prosecutors did not take the cases to court. The European 
Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in a number of cases that the justice
 system had failed to deliver a just outcome in cases of police 
brutality, particularly against Roma and cases involving abuses in 
psychiatric hospitals. The average time for a ruling in cases of alleged
 police abuse of Roma was nearly four years. In April the ECHR issued a 
ruling on a case of excessive use of force by police and the gendarmerie
 during a 2011 raid in the village of Valcele, Covasna County, against a
 Romani family that, as a consequence, suffered several injuries that 
required medical care. The ECHR noted that the decisions to organize the
 police raid and to use force against the applicants were made based on 
the victimsâ ethnic origin. According to the court, authorities 
automatically connected ethnicity to criminal behavior, and thus their 
ethnic profiling of the victims was discriminatory. The ECHR also ruled 
that domestic authorities and courts dismissed the victimsâ allegations 
of discrimination against and criminalization of the Roma without an 
in-depth analysis of the relevant circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>Police officers were frequently exonerated in cases of alleged 
beatings and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. A widespread 
perception of police corruption and inefficiency contributed to 
citizensâ lack of respect for police. Low salaries also contributed to 
making individual law enforcement officials susceptible to bribery.</p>
<p>According to the United Nations, three allegations of sexual 
exploitation and abuse by Romanian peacekeepers reported in 2017 and 
2018 were pending. All cases involved military observers deployed in UN 
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. One case 
involved the alleged sexual abuse (rape) of a minor. The peacekeeper in 
question was repatriated by the United Nations. The other two cases 
involved alleged sexual exploitation (transactional sex). Investigations
 by Romanian authorities were pending.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h3>

					
					<p>Prison conditions remained harsh and overcrowded and did not 
meet international standards. The abuse of prisoners by authorities and 
other prisoners reportedly continued to be a problem.</p>
<p><u>Physical </u><u>C</u><u>onditions</u>: According to official 
figures, overcrowding was a problem, particularly in those prisons that 
did not meet the standard of four square meters (43 square feet) per 
prisoner set by the Council of Europe. Conditions remained generally 
poor within the prison system, and observers noted insufficient spending
 on repair and retrofitting. According to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, men and women, juveniles and adults, and pretrial detainees and
 convicted persons were not held together.</p>
<p>Media outlets, NGOs, and the ombudsperson reported that prisoners 
regularly assaulted and abused fellow inmates. In 2018 a total of 633 
complaints against penitentiary staff had been lodged with the National 
Penitentiary Authority (NPA) for abuses of inmatesâ rights, acts of 
discrimination, mistreatment, and inappropriate behavior. According to 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the NPA did not refer any of the 
complaints submitted by inmates in 2018 to prosecutors. Inmates have the
 possibility of filing complaints with law enforcement agencies and 
judges. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that in 2018 judges 
admitted 317 complaints filed by inmates, compared with 506 in 2017.</p>
<p>A number of prisons provided insufficient medical care, and inmates 
complained that food quality was poor and sometimes insufficient in 
quantity. In some prisons heating and ventilation were inadequate. 
According to the Association for the Defense of Human Rights-Helsinki 
Committee (ADHR-HC), inmates did not have access to adequate counseling,
 and many psychologist and social worker positions were not filled. 
Persons with mental disorders did not receive sufficient care and were 
frequently isolated by other inmates. The ADHR-HC stated that the actual
 number of persons who had mental health problems was three times higher
 than the number of inmates who received treatment for mental illness.</p>
<p>The ADHR-HC stated that some pretrial detention facilities had 
inadequate conditions, particularly in terms of hygiene and 
overcrowding. Such facilities were often located in basements and had no
 natural light and inadequate sanitation. In some pretrial facilities 
and prisons, there was no possibility for confidential meetings between 
detainees and their families or attorneys. The ADHR-HC also criticized 
the lack of HIV and hepatitis prevention measures.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: Independent authorities did not always investigate credible allegations of inhuman conditions.</p>
<p><u>Independent </u><u>Monitoring</u>: The government permitted 
monitoring visits by independent human rights observers, and such visits
 occurred during the year. The ombudsperson also visited prisons as part
 of his mandate to monitor places of confinement.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and 
detention, and the government generally respected these prohibitions. 
The law provides for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness
 of his or her detention.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>

					
					<p>By law only judges may issue detention and search warrants, and 
the government generally respected this provision. Authorities must 
inform detainees at the time of their arrest of the charges against them
 and their legal rights, including the right to remain silent and the 
right to an attorney. Police must notify detainees of their rights in a 
language they understand before obtaining a statement and bring them 
before a court within 24 hours of arrest. Although authorities generally
 respected these requirements, there were some reports of abuses during 
the year. Pending trial, if the alleged offender does not pose any 
danger to conducting the trial, there is no concern of flight or 
commission of another crime, and the case does not present a âreasonable
 suspicionâ that the person would have committed the offense, the 
investigation proceeds with the alleged offender at liberty. Depending 
on the circumstances of the case, the law allows home detention and 
pretrial investigation under judicial supervision, which requires the 
person accused to report regularly to law enforcement officials. A bail 
system also exists but was seldom used. Detainees have the right to 
counsel and, in most cases, had prompt access to a lawyer of their 
choice. Authorities provided indigent detainees legal counsel at public 
expense. The arresting officer is also responsible for contacting the 
detaineeâs lawyer or, alternatively, the local bar association to 
arrange for a lawyer. A detainee has the right to meet privately with 
counsel before the first police interview. A lawyer may be present 
during the interview or interrogation.</p>
<p>The law allows police to take an individual to a police station 
without a warrant for endangering others or disrupting public order. 
Police reportedly used this provision to hold persons for up to 24 
hours. Since those held in such cases were not formally detained or 
arrested, authorities did not recognize their right to counsel. The 
ADHR-HC criticized this provision as leaving room for abuse.</p>
<p><u>Pretrial Detention</u>: A judge may order pretrial detention for 
up to 30 days. A court may extend this period in 30-day increments up to
 a maximum of 180 days. Under the law detainees may hold courts and 
prosecutors liable for unjustifiable, illegal, or abusive measures.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>Lack of sufficient personnel, physical space, and technology to 
enable the judiciary to act swiftly and efficiently continued, resulting
 in excessively long trials.</p>
<p>The constitution provides for an independent judiciary. The Superior 
Council of Magistrates is the countryâs judicial governance body and is 
responsible for protecting judicial independence. It generally 
maintained transparency of operations and acted to suspend judges and 
prosecutors suspected of legal violations. There were reports, however, 
that the Judicial Inspectorate, an autonomous disciplinary unit within 
the council, was subject to increasing political influence and was 
occasionally used to investigate magistrates prosecuting or ruling 
against the governing coalitionâs officials or allies.</p>
<p>The government generally respected judicial independence and 
impartiality, but instances of political messaging targeting courts, 
prosecutors, or judges increased. Some prosecutors and judges complained
 to the council that media outlets and politiciansâ statements damaged 
their professional reputations. The council determined some politiciansâ
 public statements infringed on judicial independence.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-8" class="report__section-subtitle">Trial Procedures</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and the law provide for the right to a fair and
 public trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this 
right.</p>
<p>Under the law defendants enjoy the right to the presumption of 
innocence, have the right to be informed promptly and in detail of the 
charges against them, and have the right to free linguistic 
interpretation, as necessary, from the moment charged through all 
appeals. Trials should take place without undue delay, but delays were 
common due to heavy caseloads or procedural inconsistencies. Defendants 
have the right to be present at trial. The law provides for the right to
 counsel and the right to consult an attorney in a timely manner. The 
law requires that the government provide an attorney to juveniles in 
criminal cases; the Ministry of Justice paid local bar associations to 
provide attorneys to indigent clients. Defendants may confront or 
question witnesses against them (unless the witness is an undercover 
agent) and present witnesses and evidence on their own behalf. The law 
generally provides for the right of defendants and their attorneys to 
view and consult case files, but prosecutors may restrict access to 
evidence for such reasons as protecting the victimâs rights and national
 security. Both prosecutors and defendants have a right of appeal. 
Defendants may not be compelled to testify against themselves and have 
the right to abstain from making statements. Prosecutors may use any 
statements by defendants against them in court.</p>
<p>The law allows for home detention using electronic monitoring 
devices, but the government did not procure such devices, and persons 
were placed under home detention without them. A judge may detain a 
person for up to five years during a trial, which is deducted from the 
prison sentence if the person is convicted.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-9" class="report__section-subtitle">Political Prisoners and Detainees</h3>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-10" class="report__section-subtitle">Civil Judicial Procedures and Remedies</h3>

					
					<p>Civil courts are independent and function in every jurisdiction.
 Judicial and administrative remedies are available to individuals and 
organizations for violations of human rights by government agencies. 
Plaintiffs may appeal adverse judgments involving alleged violations of 
human rights by the state to the ECHR after exhausting the avenues of 
appeal in domestic courts.</p>
<p>Approximately 80 percent of court cases were civil cases. Caseloads 
were distributed unevenly, resulting in vastly different efficiency 
rates in different regions. A lack of both jurisprudence and a modern 
case management system contributed to a high number of appeals as well 
as lengthy trials. Litigants sometimes encountered difficulties 
enforcing civil verdicts because the procedures for enforcing court 
orders were unwieldy and prolonged.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-11" class="report__section-subtitle">Property Restitution</h3>

					
					<p>According to the National Authority for Property Restitution 
(ANRP), the Jewish community is entitled to receive compensation for 
buildings and land that belonged to the Judaic religious denomination or
 legal entities of the Jewish community that were confiscated between 
September 6, 1940, and December 22, 1989. Individuals are entitled to 
compensation only for real estate confiscated between 1945 and 1989. The
 government has laws and mechanisms in place to address Holocaust-era 
property claims, and NGOs and advocacy groups reported some progress on 
resolution of such claims.</p>
<p>The law for returning property seized by the former communist and 
fascist regimes includes a âpointsâ system to compensate claimants where
 restitution of the original property is not possible. Claimants may use
 the points to bid in auctions of state-owned property or exchange them 
for monetary compensation. The parliament intended the law to speed up 
restitution, but local authorities hindered property restitution by 
failing to complete a land inventory stipulated by law. The government 
twice extended the deadline for the inventoryâs completion.</p>
<p>There were numerous disputes over church buildings and property that 
the Romanian Orthodox Church failed to return to the Greek Catholic 
Church, despite court orders to do so. The government did not take 
effective action to return churches confiscated by the post-World War II
 communist government. There continued to be lengthy delays in 
processing claims related to properties owned by national minority 
communities. Under the law there is a presumption of abusive transfer 
that applies to restitution of private property but not to religious or 
communal property. In many cases, documents attesting to the abusive 
transfer of such properties to state ownership no longer existed. 
Religious and national minorities are not entitled to compensation for 
nationalized buildings that were demolished.</p>
<p>Associations of former owners asserted that the points compensation 
system was ineffective and criticized the restitution law for failing to
 resolve cases fairly, as well as for lengthy delays and corruption. 
While the pace of resolving restitution cases at the administrative 
level increased, the number of properties returned involving churches 
and national minorities was disproportionately low. As of August the 
government had approved the restitution of seven properties to religious
 denominations, approved compensation in 24 cases, and rejected 376 
other claims. In 12 cases the filers renounced their claims. The number 
of cases resolved annually has remained approximately constant over the 
past three years, (an average of 1,300), but the number of positive 
decisions remained extremely low. Religious communities disputing these 
rulings continued having to go to court and incur additional costs. As 
of September there were 4,651 pending requests for restitution from 
religious denominations.</p>
<p>According to advocates of the Romanian Jewish community, the 
disappearance of entire document repositories, combined with limited 
access to other archives, prevented the Jewish community from filing 
certain claims before the legal deadlines. The ANRP rejected most 
restitution claims concerning former Jewish communal properties during 
its administrative procedure. The Caritatea Foundation, established by 
the Federation of Jewish Communities in Romania and World Jewish 
Restitution Organization (WJRO) to claim communal properties, reported 
it challenged these negative ANRP decisions in court. The WJRO also 
reported that the restitution of heirless private Jewish properties was 
not completed and that there was insufficient research concerning 
property that had belonged to Jewish victims of the Holocaust.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for freedom of expression, including 
for the press, and the government partially respected this right. 
Independent media organizations noted excessive politicization of the 
media, corrupt financing mechanisms, and editorial policies subordinated
 to the former elected ruling party and ownersâ interests. Reporters 
said their freedom of expression was also limited by restricted access 
to information of public interest issued by the previous government and 
public institutions, including expenses, contracts, or bids involving 
public funds, and officialsâ academic records. Reporters and NGOs often 
had to sue state-controlled ministries, agencies, or local entities to 
access public information.</p>
<p><u>Freedom of </u><u>Expression</u>: The law prohibits denying the 
Holocaust and promoting or using the symbols of fascist, racist, 
xenophobic, or Legionnaire ideologies, the last being the nationalist, 
extremist, anti-Semitic interwar movement. Various government bodies, 
mainly the gendarmerie, continued to fine, place under temporary arrest,
 ban, or block individuals who protested in the streets against 
corruption, the government, the early release of inmates, or child abuse
 and for better health, education, and social services. When fines were 
challenged, some courts ruled in favor of the protesters. On May 5, in a
 high-profile case, the Bucharest Court rejected the gendarmerieâs 
appeal in the case of Ioan Duia, who is deaf and mute and was fined 
2,000 lei ($500) by the gendarmerie for shouting slogans against the 
ruling party.</p>
<p><u>Press </u><u>and Media</u><u>, Including Online Media</u>: While 
independent media were active and expressed a wide variety of views 
without overt restriction, politicians or persons with close ties to 
politicians and political groups either owned or indirectly controlled 
numerous media outlets at the national and local levels. The news and 
editorial stance of these outlets frequently reflected their ownersâ 
views and targeted criticism at political opponents and other media 
organizations.</p>
<p><u>Violence and Harassment</u>: Dozens of reporters throughout the 
country continued to be harassed, sued, or threatened by the authorities
 they investigated or by their proxies. On March 22, former justice 
minister Tudorel Toader refused to renew accreditation for private 
ProTVâs reporter Ovidiu Oanta and Realitatea TVâs Ionela Arcanu, both of
 whom covered justice issues. Toader invoked a law stating that an 
accreditation can be refused if the reporter âdisturbs the activity of 
that institution.â The two journalists were known for their tough 
questions during his news conferences. Following NGO and independent 
media protests and allegations that the minister might have violated the
 constitution, Oantaâs accreditations were returned. Arcanu was 
reaccredited on May 8, after Toader left office.</p>
<p>On April 15, journalist Emilia Èercan, who investigated cases of 
plagiarism by government officials, reported that she had received death
 threats. She filed a criminal complaint, and on September 18, DGA 
prosecutors charged the former rector of the National Police Academy, 
Adrian Iacob, and the former deputy rector, Mihail-Petrica Marcoci, with
 instigating blackmail and instructing police officer Gheorghe Adrian 
Barbulescu to issue death threats against the reporter to stop her 
investigations. On December 10, Bucharest Court sentenced Barbulescu to 
one year in prison. Because he collaborated with prosecutors and 
disclosed the superiors who ordered him to issue the threats, he was not
 sent to jail. Instead, the court mandated that he would be monitored by
 the probation service for two years. The ruling in Barbulescuâs case 
was not final.</p>
<p>On June 11, reporter Diana Oncioiu of the Let There Be Light (Sa Fie 
Lumina) media project received death threats while she was investigating
 the sexual abuse of students at Husi Theological Seminary in Vaslui 
County. An unknown individual told the reporter that her head would be 
âripped offâ if she continued to document private matters of the 
Romanian Orthodox Church. Following the reporterâs criminal complaint, 
police identified the suspect as Dragos T., a former student of the Husi
 Seminary. In September, however, prosecutors decided not to pursue 
criminal charges against Dragos T., as the threats âwere not 
premeditated but a spontaneous gestureâ and ordered him to perform 50 
days of community service. In <i>Dela0.ro</i>, Oncioiu published an 
investigation into sexual child abuse cases that found courts determined
 three out of four cases were considered consensual. In November the 
Superior Council of Magistrates chair Lia Savonea requested the Judicial
 Inspection to investigate whether another article by Oncioiu published 
in <i>Dela0.ro</i> affected âjudicial independenceâ and âmagistratesâ 
impartiality.â The Judicial Inspectorateâs investigation against the 
reporter and the outlet remained pending.</p>

					<p>The government did not systematically restrict or disrupt access
 to the internet or censor online content, and there were no credible 
reports that the government monitored private online communications 
without appropriate legal authority. During the year, however, many 
individuals in various counties continued to be fined for criticizing or
 using derogatory language on Facebook, mainly against interior ministry
 employees or agencies. On January 21, the Satu Mare police told local 
media that they fined three individuals 200 lei ($50) each for insulting
 police officers for parking their cars in parking spaces designated for
 persons with disabilities. Following the fine, the Facebook page 
featuring instances of illegal parking was disabled.</p>

asked for damages of 100,000 euros ($110,000) and public apologies for

assembly.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Freedom of Peaceful Assembly</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for freedom of peaceful assembly, 
which the government has generally respected. The law provides that 
unarmed citizens may assemble peacefully but also stipulates that 
meetings must not interfere with other economic or social activities and
 may not take place near such locations as hospitals, airports, or 
military installations. In most cases organizers of public assemblies 
must request permits in writing three days in advance from the mayorâs 
office of the locality where the gathering is to occur.</p>
<p>In October 2018 the Supreme Court ruled that public gatherings, 
including protests, must be declared in advance when they are to be held
 in markets, public spaces, or in the vicinity of institutions âof 
public or private interest.â The decision was mandatory. Activists 
opposed these restrictions, stating that by announcing the protests, 
those who take to the streets will be forced to take responsibility not 
only for themselves, but also for larger groups or for instigators to 
violence who may be brought there to compromise peaceful anticorruption 
protests. Civic organizations also warned that in Bucharest authorities 
granted public spaces for longer periods to NGOs with no activity only 
as a pretext to refuse permits to protest to legitimate organizations.</p>
<p>In August 2018 a protest at Victoria Square in Bucharest attracted 
approximately 100,000 protesters. According to the Ministry of Interior,
 several hundred persons allegedly attempted to get close to the cabinet
 office building and threw objects at gendarmes. Media and civic groups 
reported the number of violent protesters was much lower, amounting to 
several dozens of persons. Gendarmes used tear gas and water cannon 
indiscriminately, harming peaceful protesters, some of whom were 
children or elderly. NGOs, observers, and journalists noted gendarmes 
launched tear gas canisters in adjacent areas of the square against 
persons who did not pose a threat. Gendarmes also used violence against 
protesters who left the protest and were on adjacent streets. Numerous 
broadcast television reports showed members of the gendarmerie punching,
 kicking, and hitting peaceful protesters, with their batons. Several 
protesters suffered injuries caused by shrapnel from exploding tear-gas 
canisters.</p>
<p>More than 770 criminal complaints concerning violent incidents during
 the August 2018 protest that allegedly constituted excessive force 
against peaceful protesters were submitted to law enforcement. During 
the year investigations into alleged attacks by gendarmerie against 
protesters remained stalled, and the case was transferred from one 
prosecutorâs office to another.</p>

					<p>The constitution and law provide for the freedom of internal 
movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the 
government generally respected these rights.</p>
<p><u>In-country Movement</u>: The internal movement of beneficiaries of
 international protection and stateless persons was generally not 
restricted. Asylum seekers may be subject to measures limiting their 
freedom of movement and to detention in specific circumstances. The law 
and implementing regulations provide that the General Inspectorate for 
Immigration may designate a specific place of residence for an applicant
 for asylum while authorities determine his or her eligibility, or may 
take restrictive measures, subject to approval by the prosecutorâs 
office, that amount to administrative detention in âspecially arranged 
closed areas.â According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), as of October no such cases of asylum detention were 
recorded during the year. Applicants who do not qualify for asylum are 
treated as aliens without a right to stay in the country and may be 
taken into custody pending deportation. According to the law, those 
applying for asylum while in public custody were released from detention
 if granted access to the ordinary procedure. Detention in public 
custody centers is subject to regular review and should not exceed six 
months unless there are specific circumstances, in which case detention 
may be extended for up to 18 months. Applicants for or beneficiaries of 
international protection in certain circumstances, particularly those 
declared âundesirableâ for reasons of national security, may be subject 
to administrative detention in public custody centers.</p>
<p>The government may grant âtolerated statusâ to persons who do not 
meet the requirements for refugee status or subsidiary protection, but 
who cannot be returned for various reasons. These reasons include cases 
where stateless persons are not accepted by their former country of 
habitual residence or where the lives or well-being of returnees could 
be at risk. Persons with âtolerated statusâ have the right to work but 
not to benefit from any other social protection or inclusion provisions,
 and the government restricted their freedom of movement to a specific 
region of the country.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-10" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Protection of Refugees</h3>

					
					<p><u>Abuse of Migrants, Refugees, and Stateless Persons</u>: 
According to UNHCR, several incidents of harassment, discrimination, and
 crimes against refugees and migrants were reported throughout the year 
in Bucharest and other parts of the country, although most incidents 
were not reported because of fear, lack of information, inadequate 
support services, and inefficient redress mechanisms.</p>
<p>The government cooperated with UNHCR and other humanitarian 
organizations in providing protection and assistance to refugees, asylum
 seekers, stateless persons, and other persons of concern, which could 
include irregular migrants potentially in need of international 
protection.</p>
<p><u>Refoulement</u>: The law establishes exceptions to the principle 
of nonrefoulement and the withdrawal of the right to stay following a 
declaration of a person as âundesirable.â This may occur, for example, 
when classified information or âwell founded indicationsâ suggest that 
aliens (including applicants for asylum, or persons granted asylum) 
intend to commit terrorist acts or favor terrorism. Applicants for 
protection declared âundesirableâ on national security grounds were 
taken into custody pending the finalization of their asylum procedure 
and then deported.</p>
<p><u>Access to Asylum</u>: The law provides access to asylum procedures
 to foreign nationals and stateless persons who express their desire for
 protection, which may be in the form of refugee status or temporary 
âsubsidiary protectionâ status. The asylum law prohibits the expulsion, 
extradition, or forced return of any asylum seeker at the countryâs 
border or from within the countryâs territory, but this was not without 
exception, particularly in cases that fell under the countryâs national 
security and terrorism laws.</p>
<p>The law also refers to the concept of a safe third country. The law 
extends to irregular migrants who transited and were offered protection 
in a third country considered safe or who had the opportunity at the 
border or on the soil of a safe third country to contact authorities for
 the purpose of obtaining protection. In such cases authorities could 
deny access to asylum procedures if the designated safe third country 
agreed to readmit the applicant to its territory and grant access to 
asylum procedures.</p>
<p><u>Freedom of </u><u>M</u><u>ovement</u>: The law incorporates four 
ârestrictiveâ measures under which the internal movement of applicants 
for asylum may be limited. The first two establish an obligation to 
report regularly to the General Inspectorate for Immigration or to 
reside at a regional reception center. A third restrictive measure 
allows authorities to place applicants in âspecially arranged closed 
areasâ for a maximum of 60 days, either to access the asylum procedure 
or if the asylum seeker is deemed to pose a danger to national security.
 There was no case of an asylum applicant being placed in a specially 
arranged closed area through October. Authorities may also place asylum 
applicants in administrative detention in a public custody center if 
they are subject to a transfer to another EU member state under the 
Dublin Regulations or if they have been declared âundesirableâ for 
reasons of national security, pending their removal from the country.</p>
<p>According to UNHCR, irregular migrants, persons declared as 
âundesirable,â asylum seekers deemed to pose a ârisk of absconding,â as 
well as other categories of foreigners may face detention in public 
custody centers. Under provisions of the law to limit âabuse to the 
asylum procedure,â irregular migrants who submitted their first 
application for international protection while in custody were released 
from detention only if granted access to the ordinary asylum application
 procedure. The provisions raised concerns among UN agencies and civil 
society due to the ambiguity in the phrases âabuse of the asylum 
procedureâ and ârisk of absconding.â</p>
<p>The period of detention in a public custody center could be prolonged up to a maximum of 18 months.</p>
<p>Employment: While persons granted international protection have the 
legal right to work, job scarcity, low wages, lack of language 
proficiency, and lack of recognized academic degrees and other 
certifications often resulted in unemployment or employment without a 
legal contract and its related benefits and protections. Obtaining a 
legal work contract remained difficult for various reasons, including 
tax concerns and the reluctance of employers to hire refugees.</p>
<p><u>Access to Basic Services</u>: Effective access by persons with 
refugee status or subsidiary protection to education, housing, lifelong 
learning and employment, public health care, and social security varied 
across the country, depending on the level of awareness of various 
public and private actors responsible for ensuring access to these 
services.</p>
<p>Recipients of subsidiary protection complained of problems regarding 
their freedom of movement to other countries due to the additional visa 
requirements. UNHCR reported that refugees saw citizenship acquisition 
as a cumbersome, costly, and difficult process, with some requirements, 
particularly related to the applicantâs financial situation, that were 
difficult to meet.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-11" class="report__section-subtitle">g. Stateless Persons</h3>

					
					<p>According to UNHCR, as of June there were 337 stateless persons 
with valid residence documents in the country. These included legal 
residents under the aliensâ regime, stateless persons of Romanian 
origin, as well as 112 persons granted some form of international 
protection. Data on stateless persons, including on persons at risk of 
statelessness and persons of undetermined nationality, were not reliable
 due to the absence of a procedure to determine statelessness, the 
absence of a single designated authority responsible for this purpose, 
and the lack of adequate identification and registration of persons with
 unknown or undetermined nationality.</p>
<p>The law includes favorable provisions for stateless persons of 
Romanian origin to reacquire citizenship. Nevertheless, a significant 
gap persisted due to the lack of safeguards against statelessness for 
children born in the country, who would be stateless because their 
parents either were themselves stateless or were foreigners unable to 
transmit their nationality.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-3__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Elections and Political Participation</h3>

					
					<p><u>Recent </u><u>Elections</u>: On November 10 and 24, the 
country held presidential elections that were considered free and fair 
and without significant irregularities. In 2016 the country held 
parliamentary elections that election observers also considered free and
 fair. Amendments to election legislation signed into law in July 
improved conditions for Romanian citizens residing abroad to exercise 
their right to vote, including early voting, voting by mail, and 
extended voting hours at polling stations.</p>
<p><u>Political Parties</u><u> and Political Participation</u>: The law 
requires political parties to register with the Bucharest Tribunal and 
to submit their statutes, program, and a roster of at least three 
members. Critics asserted that certain requirements undermine the 
freedom of association. These include the requirement that parties field
 candidatesâby themselves or in allianceâin at least 75 electoral 
constituencies in two successive local elections, or that they field a 
full slate of candidates in at least one county or partial slates of 
candidates in a minimum of three counties in two successive 
parliamentary elections. A partyâs statutes and program must not include
 ideas that incite war; discrimination; hatred of a national, racist, or
 religious nature; or territorial separatism.</p>
<p><u>Participation of Women and Minorities</u>: No laws limit 
participation of women or members of minorities in the political 
process, and they did participate. Societal attitudes presented a 
significant barrier, and women remained underrepresented in positions of
 authority. As of December 1, there were 72 women in the 329-seat 
Chamber of Deputies and 19 women in the 136-seat Senate.</p>
<p>Under the constitution each recognized ethnic minority is entitled to
 a representative in the Chamber of Deputies. An organization is 
required, however, to receive votes equal to 5 percent of the national 
average number of votes cast by district for a deputy to be elected. The
 list of organizations that benefit from these provisions is limited to 
those that are already part of a National Council of Minorities, which 
consists of organizations already in parliament. The law sets more 
stringent requirements for minority organizations without a presence in 
parliament. To participate in elections, such organizations must provide
 the Central Electoral Bureau a membership list equal to at least 15 
percent of the total number of persons belonging to that ethnic group, 
as determined by the most recent census. If this number amounts to more 
than 20,000 persons, the organization must submit a list with at least 
20,000 names distributed among a minimum of 15 counties plus the city of
 Bucharest, with no fewer than 300 persons from each county. Some 
organizations and individuals, particularly Romani activists, claimed 
this rule was discriminatory.</p>
<p>Ethnic Hungarians, represented by the Democratic Union of Hungarians 
in Romania political party, were the sole ethnic minority to gain 
parliamentary representation by surpassing the 5 percent threshold of 
all valid votes cast nationally, the threshold set for political 
parties. One Romani organization, Roma Party-Pro Europe, had a single 
representative in parliament.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for corruption by officials.
 Nevertheless, corrupt practices remained widespread despite several 
high-profile prosecutions. There were numerous reports of government 
corruption during the year.</p>
<p>According to World Bank indicators and other expert opinion, 
corruption remained a problem. Bribery was common in the public sector. 
Laws were not always implemented effectively, and officials sometimes 
engaged in corrupt practices with impunity.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: The DGA continued to investigate and prosecute 
corruption cases involving political and administrative officials 
throughout the year. In June the Senate rejected the DGAâs request to 
open a criminal investigation of Senate President Calin Popescu 
Tariceanu for bribery, and in September the Senate rejected the DGAâs 
request to open a criminal investigation of former health minister 
Florian Bodog for abuse of office. In February the High Court convicted 
and sentenced former Constanta mayor Radu Mazare and 31 other 
codefendants to nine years in prison for fraudulent real estate 
transactions. In May the High Court convicted speaker and party chair 
Liviu Dragnea to three and one-half years in prison for instigation to 
abuse of office.</p>
<p>Verdicts in corruption cases were often inconsistent, with sentences 
varying widely for similar offenses. Enforcement of court procedures 
lagged mostly due to procedural and administrative problems, especially 
with respect to asset forfeiture.</p>
<p>A series of emergency ordinances and other legislative amendments to 
judicial statutes enacted in 2018 created several conflicting provisions
 and triggered legislative confusion and public protests from a 
significant number of judges and prosecutors during the year. While the 
former government repealed some of provisions, it left in place 
provisions establishing the Section to Investigate Offenses in the 
Judiciary, an entity that judicial and law-enforcement stakeholders 
publicly criticized as having the potential to intimidate judges and 
prosecutors.</p>
<p>Corruption was widespread in public procurement. A 2016 law provides 
for a comprehensive software mechanism to flag potential conflicts of 
interest in public procurement, but the law was not implemented. Bribery
 was common in the public sector, especially in health care. Individual 
executive agencies were slow in enforcing sanctions, and agenciesâ own 
inspection bodies were generally inactive. Despite the emphasis on 
prevention in the latest <i>National Anti</i><i>c</i><i>orruption Strategy</i>, individual agencies and the government did not take significant action in this area.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: The law empowers the National Integrity 
Agency (ANI) to administer and audit financial disclosure statements for
 all public officials and to monitor conflicts of interest. The law 
stipulates that the agency may identify âsignificant discrepanciesâ 
between an officialâs income and assets, defined as more than 45,000 lei
 ($11,250), and allows for seizure and forfeiture of unjustified assets.
 The mechanism for confiscation of âunjustified assetsâ was cumbersome. 
Through September 15, ANI identified three cases of âsignificant 
discrepanciesâ totaling 3.3 million lei ($825,000). Through September 
15, ANI identified 97 cases of incompatibilities, 26 cases of conflicts 
of interest, and eight cases with strong indications of criminal or 
corruption offenses. During the year ANI reviewed 14,000 public 
procurement procedures and issued 25 integrity warnings.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A number of domestic and international human rights groups 
generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
generally met with human rights NGOs and were cooperative and sometimes 
responsive to their views.</p>
<p>There were some reports that government officials were reluctant to 
cooperate with NGOs that focused on institutionalized persons with 
disabilities or to accept NGO criticism of institutions for persons with
 disabilities. In 2017 the Ministry of Labor and Social Justice ceased 
to allow representatives of the Center for Legal Resources (CLR) to 
visit institutions for persons with disabilities, stating that the 
ministryâs agreement with the CLR would not be renewed. In March the 
National Center for Mental Health and Antidrug Fight, a governmental 
agency subordinated to the Ministry of Health, revoked a recently issued
 authorization allowing the CLR to visit institutions for persons with 
disabilities. The CLR is an NGO that reports on alleged abuse of 
institutionalized persons with disabilities.</p>
<p><u>Government Human Rights Bodies</u>: The Office of the Ombudsperson
 has limited power and no authority to protect citizensâ constitutional 
rights in cases requiring judicial action. The Office of the 
Ombudsperson is the only institution that may challenge emergency 
ordinances in the Constitutional Court and did so for several 
controversial ordinances. The ombudsperson is the national preventive 
mechanism implementing the optional protocol to the UN Convention 
against Torture. This gives the ombudsperson the power to conduct 
monitoring visits to places where individuals are deprived of their 
liberty, including prisons, psychiatric hospitals, and asylum centers. 
As of September the ombudsperson issued 77 recommendations to 
penitentiaries, schools, law enforcement agencies, and other 
governmental institutions.</p>
<p>In 2017 the government established the Office of the Childrenâs 
Ombudsperson empowered to examine human rights complaints made by 
children or their legal representatives. In 2016 parliament established 
the Council for Monitoring the Implementation of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The council was authorized to make 
unannounced visits in centers and hospitals for persons with 
disabilities to check if the rights of these persons were respected, 
issue recommendations, and submit criminal complaints. As of September 
the council had issued 37 reports during the year with recommendations 
based on visits to residential centers for persons with disabilities. 
Observers reported the councilâs recommendations and reports were 
inaccurate and noted that conditions had not improved. Human rights 
activists and media regarded the institution as ineffective and believed
 that the inspectors who drafted the reports lacked the necessary human 
rights expertise.</p>
<p>Each chamber of parliament has a human rights committee tasked with 
drafting reports on bills pertaining to human rights. On several 
occasions members of these committees expressed the views of their 
political parties rather than addressing problems impartially.</p>
<p>The National Council for Combating Discrimination (CNCD) is the 
government agency responsible for applying domestic and EU 
antidiscrimination laws. The CNCD reports to parliament. The CNCD 
operated with the governmentâs cooperation and, for the most part, 
without government or party interference. According to the CNCD, the 
institution did not receive adequate resources. Observers generally 
regarded the CNCD as effective, but some criticized it for a lack of 
efficiency and political independence.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">Women</h3>

					
					<p><u>Rape and Domestic Violence</u>: Rape, including spousal rape,
 is illegal. The law provides for three to 10 yearsâ imprisonment for 
rape and two to seven yearsâ imprisonment for sexual assault. If there 
are no aggravating circumstances and the attack did not lead to death, 
police and prosecutors may not pursue a case on their own, but they 
require a victimâs complaint, even if there is independent physical 
evidence.</p>
<p>The criminal code classifies family violence as a separate offense 
and stipulates that when murder, battery, or other serious violence is 
committed against a family member, the penalty is increased. The code 
also states that, if the parties reconcile, criminal liability is 
removed.</p>
<p>Violence against women, including spousal abuse, continued to be a 
serious problem that the government did not effectively address. The law
 provides for the issuance of provisional restraining orders by police 
for a maximum of five days and restraining orders by a court for a 
maximum of six months upon the victimâs request or at the request of a 
prosecutor, the state representative in charge of protecting victims of 
family violence, or, if the victim agrees, a social service provider. 
Violation of a restraining order is punishable by imprisonment for one 
month to one year. The court may also order an abuser to undergo 
psychological counselling. The FILIA Center for Gender Studies and 
Curriculum Developmentâan NGO that aims to promote gender 
equalityâstated that police lacked procedures for the implementation and
 monitoring of restraining orders.</p>
<p>Police condoned violence against women and girls. In April the head 
of the Bacau County Police Inspectorate stated during a radio show that,
 if a husband hits his wife intentionally or unintentionally during the 
night and then he calms down, the victim should not call police on the 
emergency hotline. Several human rights activists reported that some 
police officers try to dissuade victims of rape from pressing charges 
against their aggressors and, in some cases, refuse to register criminal
 complaints submitted by victims. In August media outlets reported the 
case of a woman who went to a police precinct in Bucharest to press 
charges immediately after she was raped. According to the victimâs 
testimony, police officers repeatedly asked her whether she was certain 
that she wanted to press charges, whether she sought revenge, and 
whether she was aware that she would destroy the alleged aggressorâs 
life by pressing charges.</p>
<p>Courts prosecuted very few cases of domestic abuse. Many cases were 
resolved before or during trial when the alleged victims dropped their 
charges or reconciled with the alleged abuser.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Harassment</u>: Criminal law prohibits sexual harassment, 
which it defines as repeatedly asking for sexual favors in a work or 
similar relationship. A victimâs complaint is necessary to initiate a 
criminal investigation. Penalties range from fines to imprisonment of 
three months to one year. The law on equal opportunities for men and 
women defines sexual harassment as the occurrence of unwanted behavior 
with a sexual connotation, which can be expressed physically, verbally, 
or nonverbally and has the effect or result of damaging a personâs 
dignity and, in particular, the creation of a hostile, intimidating, 
degrading, humiliating, or offensive environment. Civil fines range from
 3,000 to 10,000 lei ($750 to $2,500).</p>
<p><u>Coercion in Population Control</u>: There were no reports of coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: Under the law women and men enjoy equal 
rights. Women experienced discrimination in marriage, divorce, child 
custody, employment, credit, pay, owning or managing businesses or 
property, education, the judicial process, and housing. The law requires
 equal pay for equal work, but there was a 3.5-percent gender pay gap 
according to EU data. Segregation by profession existed, with women 
overrepresented in lower-paying jobs. There were reports of 
discrimination in employment.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">Children</h3>

					
					<p><u>Birth </u><u>R</u><u>egistration</u>: Children derive 
citizenship by birth from at least one citizen parent. Although birth 
registration is mandatory by law, it was not universal, and authorities 
denied some children public services as a result. Most unregistered 
children had access to schools, and authorities assisted in obtaining 
birth documents for unregistered children, but the education of 
unregistered children depended on the decision of school authorities. 
The law provides simplified birth registration for children whose 
mothers do not have proper documentation to register their children.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: Child abuse, including emotional, physical, and 
psychological violence and neglect, continued to be serious problems. 
Media outlets reported several severe cases of abuse or neglect in 
family homes, foster care, and child welfare institutions. The 
government has not established a mechanism to identify and treat abused 
and neglected children and their families.</p>
<p><u>Early and </u><u>Forced </u><u>Marriage</u>: The legal age of 
marriage is 18 for both men and women, but the law permits minors as 
young as 16 to marry under certain circumstances. Illegal child marriage
 was reportedly common in certain social groups, particularly among some
 Romani communities. Media outlets and NGOs reported cases of Romani 
girls as young as 11 being sold into marriage by their families. Child 
protection authorities and police did not always intervene in such 
cases. There were no public policies to discourage child marriage.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: The law provides one- to 
10-year prison sentences for persons convicted of sexual acts with 
minors, depending on the circumstances and the childâs age. Sexual 
intercourse with a minor who is 13 to 15 years of age is punishable by a
 one- to five-year prison sentence. Sexual intercourse with a person 
younger than 13 is punishable by a two- to seven-year prison sentence 
and deprivation of some rights. The law also criminalizes sexual 
corruption of minors (which includes subjecting minors to sexual acts 
other than intercourse or forcing minors to perform such acts), luring 
minors for sexual purposes or child prostitution, and trafficking in 
minors. Pimping and pandering that involve minors increase sentences by 
one-half. The law allows authorities to maintain a registry of 
individuals who had committed sexual offenses against or exploited 
adults and children. As of September the register was not operational.</p>
<p>Child pornography is a separate offense and carries a sentence, 
depending on the circumstances, of up to seven yearsâ imprisonment, 
which may be increased by one-third if the perpetrator was a family 
member or someone in whose care the child was entrusted or if the life 
of the child victim was endangered.</p>
<p><u>Institutionalized Children</u>: During the year there were several
 media reports of abuses in placement centers for institutionalized 
children, including sexual abuse, physical violence by colleagues or 
staff, and trafficking in persons. Numerous reports noted a lack of 
adequate food, clothing, medical treatment, and counselling services. In
 2016 prosecutors indicted members of an organized crime network who 
were recruiting girls from orphanages in Iasi for sexual exploitation. 
In 2017 the Iasi Tribunal convicted the defendants and sentenced them to
 prison terms ranging from three to seven years for trafficking in 
minors. The defendants appealed the ruling, but a court of appeal 
confirmed the conviction in September.</p>
<p>According to media reports and NGOs, in 2018 psychiatrists 
administered psychotropic drugs to thousands of children in residential 
institutions or in foster care in order to control their behavior. 
According to official estimates, one-third of the institutionalized 
children, including those with disruptive behavior, attention-deficit, 
or hyperactivity disorder, were under psychotropic medication, but 
observers believed the number to be much higher.</p>
<p>By law unaccompanied migrant children are housed in placement 
centers, where they have access to education and benefits other children
 receive. The detention of families with children is allowed by law, 
with preservation of family unity used as justification. Several such 
cases were recorded during the year.</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is a party to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs <i>Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction</i> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200919032952/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data/reported-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">Anti-Semitism</h3>

					
					<p>According to the 2011 census, the Jewish population numbered 
3,271. Representatives of the Jewish community stated that according to 
their estimates, the Jewish population numbered approximately 7,000. 
Acts of anti-Semitism occurred during the year.</p>
<p>The law prohibits public denial of the Holocaust and fascist, racist,
 anti-Semitic, and xenophobic language and symbols, including 
organizations and symbols associated with the indigenous Legionnaire 
interwar fascist movement. The oppression of Roma as well as Jews is 
included in the definition of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Streets, organizations, schools, or libraries continued to be named 
after persons convicted for war crimes or crimes against humanity, 
according to the Elie Wiesel Institute for the Study of the Holocaust in
 Romania. For example, Radu Gyr was a commander and anti-Semitic 
ideologist of the fascist Legionnaire movement convicted of war crimes. 
The Wiesel Institute requested the renaming of Radu Gyr street in 
Cluj-Napoca. As of September the local government had not changed the 
name of the street.</p>
<p>Material promoting anti-Semitic views and glorifying legionnaires 
also appeared in media outlets, including on the internet, and several 
government officials made trivializing comments about the Holocaust. 
During an August 2 ceremony commemorating the killing of Roma during the
 Holocaust, former minister of culture Valer-Daniel Breaz described the 
Holocaust as one of the âdelicate moments, not to call them difficult or
 unpleasant, during which some minorities suffered.â The leaders of the 
Jewish community, academics, Romani and human rights activists, as well 
as several politicians criticized Breaz for his statements. Jewish 
community president Aurel Vainer stated that he disapproved of Minister 
Breazâs statements and that the killings committed during the Holocaust 
should not be ignored or minimized. Jewish Member of Parliament Silviu 
Vexler stated the language used by Breaz was unacceptable and that 
Holocaust trivialization is dangerous.</p>
<p>Messages promoting Holocaust denial and relativism appeared on the 
internet. In April, Andrei Caramitru, a prominent member of the Save 
Romania Union Party, posted on his Facebook page a message that claimed 
the Social Democratic Party was responsible for mass emigration and 
deaths following car accidents and corruption in the health sector. 
According to Caramitru, these represent a Holocaust against Romania that
 was worse than what happened to the country during the Second World 
War. Caramitru later apologized for his Facebook post.</p>
<p>In April media outlets reported a case of vandalism at a Jewish 
cemetery in Husi, where unknown individuals destroyed dozens of 
headstones. Law enforcement officials identified three suspects, and as 
of September the investigation was pending.</p>
<p>In August 2018 anti-Semitic and other offensive messages were painted
 during the night on the childhood home of Auschwitz survivor and Nobel 
laureate Elie Wiesel in Sighetu Marmatiei. The local office of the 
national police started an investigation of the incident and identified 
one suspect. In April the case was closed because a psychiatric expert 
found the suspect was unable to take responsibility for his actions.</p>
<p>The high school course <i>History of the Jews</i><i>â</i><i>T</i><i>he Holocaust</i> was optional. During the 2017-18 school year, 2,256 pupils took the course.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">Persons with Disabilities</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, 
sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities. The government did not 
fully implement the law, and discrimination against persons with 
disabilities remained a problem.</p>
<p>The law mandates that buildings and public transportation be 
accessible for persons with disabilities. The country continued to have 
an insufficient number of facilities specifically designed to 
accommodate persons with disabilities who could have extreme difficulty 
navigating city streets or gaining access to public buildings. Persons 
with disabilities reported a lack of access ramps, adapted public 
transportation, and adapted toilets in major buildings.</p>
<p>Discrimination against children with disabilities in education was a 
widespread problem due to lack of adequate teacher training on inclusion
 of children with disabilities and lack of investment to make schools 
accessible. Most children with disabilities were either placed in 
special schools or not placed in school at all. According to the NGO the
 European Center for the Rights of Children with Disabilities (ECRCD), 
abuses against children in special schools, including violence by staff,
 occurred frequently. Several reports by the ECRCD indicated that 
children with disabilities placed in regular schools faced abuse and 
discrimination from classmates and staff.</p>
<p>The CLR identified a series of problems in centers for persons with 
disabilities or psychiatric sections, including verbal and physical 
abuse of children and adults, sedation, excessive use of physical 
restraints, lack of hygiene, inadequate living conditions, and lack of 
adequate medical care. In September the CLR announced that at the Center
 for the Recovery of Persons with Disabilities in Sighetu Marmatiei, 
eight persons with disabilities were kept in cages while three other 
persons were tied to their beds. The CLR also indicated the lack of 
specialized personnel and inadequate hygiene at the center. Following 
media reports about the situation and an inspection by the county agency
 for social inspection and payments, the patients were transferred to 
other centers. According to the CLR, between 2017 and September 2018, 
some 1,447 institutionalized persons with disabilities, including 40 
children and 609 persons younger than age 70, died while in the care of 
residential centers and psychiatric sections and hospitals. In August a 
patient interned at the Sapoca Psychiatric Hospital in Buzau County 
attacked several persons with an infusion stand, killing six and 
wounding seven.</p>
<p>The National Authority for the Protection of Persons with 
Disabilities, under the labor ministry, coordinated services for persons
 with disabilities and drafted policies, strategies, and standards in 
the field of disabilities rights.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities</h3>

					
					<p>Discrimination against Roma continued to be a major problem. 
Romani groups complained that police harassment and brutality, including
 beatings, were routine. Both domestic and international media and 
observers reported societal discrimination against Roma. NGOs reported 
Roma were denied access to, or refused service in, many public places. 
Roma also experienced poor access to government services, a shortage of 
employment opportunities, high rates of school attrition, and inadequate
 health care. A lack of identity documents excluded many Roma from 
participating in elections, receiving social benefits, accessing health 
insurance, securing property documents, and participating in the labor 
market. According to the Ministry of Interior, 102,854 persons older 
than age 14 did not have identity documents. Romani rights activists 
reported that most of these persons were Roma who cannot acquire legal 
identity documents because they resided in informal settlements and 
housing. Roma had a higher unemployment rate and a lower life expectancy
 than non-Roma. Negative stereotypes and discriminatory language 
regarding Roma were widespread.</p>
<p>Despite an order by the Ministry of Education forbidding segregation 
of Romani students, several NGOs continued to report that segregation 
along ethnic lines persisted in schools. In November representatives of 
the âPro Europe Roma Partyâ NGO and human rights activists stated that 
in a public school in the city of Iasi, Romani children went on break at
 different hours of the day than ethnic Romanians in order to avoid 
interaction between the two groups. Activists also stated that at 
another public school in Iasi, Romani students were placed in segregated
 classrooms located in a separate building.</p>
<p>Researchers and activists reported a significant number of the 
remaining Romani Holocaust survivors who applied for a pension were 
denied because of unreasonable administrative barriers raised by the 
pension offices, problematic standards, lack of knowledge about the 
Holocaust and Roma, and burdensome requirements. According to 
researchers, despite historical evidence, in hundreds of cases 
authorities considered that Roma were resettled and not deported, and 
consequently granted them smaller pensions.</p>
<p>In April the driver of a minibus operated by a transportation company
 in the city of Zalau denied a Romani woman and her two children access 
to the vehicle and hit her repeatedly with a wooden stick. After she 
called the 112 emergency line to report the incident, the operator 
insulted the victim and used racial slurs against her. According to 
Romani CRISS, the attack was racially motivated. As of September the 
case was pending investigation before the prosecutorâs office in Zalau. 
As of September the Special Telecommunications Service, the body that 
operates the emergency line, was investigating the behavior of the 
operator.</p>
<p>Ethnic Hungarians continued to report discrimination related mainly 
to the use of the Hungarian language. There were continued reports that 
local authorities did not enforce the law, which states that in 
localities where a minority constitutes at least 20 percent of the 
population, road signs must be bilingual. According to the Miko Imre 
Legal Service, during Romaniaâs qualifying matches for the 2020 European
 Football Championship in June that took place in Norway and Malta, 
Romanian fans continuously shouted anti-Hungarian slogans, including, 
âOut with the Hungarians from the country!â</p>
<p>Several politicians and government officials made derogatory remarks 
about ethnic Germans and equated German ethnicity with Nazism and the 
Holocaust. On August 5, Dana Varga, an advisor to former prime minister 
Viorica Dancila, posted on her Facebook page pictures comparing 
President Klaus Iohannis, an ethnic German, to Adolf Hitler. The 
leadership of the Jewish community, the Elie Wiesel Institute, Romani 
rights activists, and several members of the opposition condemned 
Vargaâs actions.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-6__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
NGOs reported that societal discrimination against lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons was common, and 
there were some reports of violence against them. On some occasions 
police condoned violence against LGBTI persons. The NGO ACCEPT reported 
that during the year a person living near their headquarters 
continuously verbally harassed LGBTI persons who visited the NGO and its
 employees, and destroyed the property of a transgender woman. In June, 
ACCEPT submitted a criminal complaint, but as of September, police had 
not taken any measures.</p>
<p>Discrimination in employment occurred against LGBTI persons. On June 
22, a pride march with approximately 10,000 participants took place 
without incident in Bucharest. Before the event approximately 100 
persons took part in a counter protest.</p>
<p>The law governing legal gender recognition for transgender persons 
was vague and incomplete. In some cases authorities refused legal gender
 recognition unless an individual had first undergone sex reassignment 
surgery. Access to adequate psychological services was also limited 
because some psychologists refused to accept transgender patients.</p>

enforced it. Authorities did not adopt regulations that were necessary 
to provide confidentiality and fair treatment, and discrimination 
against persons with HIV/AIDS impeded access to routine medical and

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the rights of workers to form and join 
independent labor unions, bargain collectively, and conduct legal 
strikes. Unions can affiliate with regional, national, or EU union 
federations, but they may affiliate with only one national organization.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination and allows workers fired for
 union activity to challenge in court for reinstatement. The law 
provides for protection of freedom of association and collective 
bargaining, but unions complained there was little enforcement to 
protect against violations of these rights.</p>
<p>Civil servants generally have the right to establish and join unions.
 Employees of the Ministry of National Defense, certain categories of 
civilian employees of the Ministries of Interior and Justice, judges, 
prosecutors, intelligence personnel, and senior public servants, 
including the president, parliamentarians, mayors, prime minister, 
ministers, employees involved in security-related activities, and 
president of the Supreme Court, however, do not have the right to 
unionize. Unions complained about the requirement that they submit lists
 of union members with their registration application. Since employers 
also had access to the list, union officials feared this could lead to 
reprisals against individual unionized employees, particularly 
dismissals, hindering the formation of new unions.</p>
<p>The law requires employers with more than 21 employees to negotiate a
 collective labor agreement but provides no basis for national 
collective labor agreements. Employers refusing to initiate negotiation 
of a collective bargaining agreement can receive fines. The law permits,
 but does not impose, collective labor agreements for groups of 
employers or sectors of activity. The law requires employers to consult 
with unions on such topics as imposing leave without pay or reducing the
 workweek due to economic reasons.</p>
<p>Unions may strike only if they give employers 48 hoursâ notice, and 
employers can challenge the right in court, effectively suspending a 
strike for months. Military personnel and certain categories of staff 
within the Ministry of Internal Affairs, such as medical personnel, are 
not permitted to strike. Although not compulsory, unions and employers 
can seek arbitration and mediation from the Labor Ministryâs Office for 
Mediation and Arbitration. In one case unions criticized the ministry 
for failing to intervene effectively during a six-week strike at a 
household appliances production plant in Satu Mare in northwestern 
Romania. Workers were demanding a two-lei ($0.50) per hour increase in 
wages; unions claimed that the employer made little effort to engage 
constructively with employees.</p>
<p>Companies may claim damages from strike organizers if a court deems a
 strike illegal. The law permits strikes only in defense of workersâ 
economic, social, and professional interests and not for the 
modification or change of a law. As a result, workers may not challenge 
any condition of work established by law, such as salaries for public 
servants, limiting the effectiveness of unions in the public sector.</p>
<p>Unions complained that the legal requirement for representativeness, 
which states that the right to collective bargaining and to strike can 
be asserted only by a union that represents 50 percent plus one of the 
workers in an enterprise, is overly burdensome and limits the rights of 
workers to participate in collective bargaining and to strike. In the 
absence of this clear majority, an employer can appoint a worker 
representative of its choosing to negotiate the agreement. Some 
companies created separate legal entities to which they transferred 
employees, thereby preventing them from reaching the threshold for 
representation.</p>
<p>Unions complained that the governmentâs general prohibition on union 
engagement in political activities was intended to prohibit unions from 
entering unofficial agreements to support political parties. The law 
provides for this control due to past abuses by union officials. 
Authorities could exercise excessive control over union finances, 
although the government asserted that national fiscal laws apply to all 
organizations. The International Labor Organizationâs Committee of 
Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations identified
 fiscal laws as an area of concern.</p>
<p>Official reports of incidents of antiunion discrimination remained 
minimal, as it was difficult to prove legally that employers laid off 
employees in retaliation for union activities. The CNCD fines employers 
for antiunion discrimination, although it lacks the power to order 
reinstatement or other penalties. In 2018 the CNCD issued fines in 19 
cases involving access to employment and profession, which includes 
antiunion discrimination and collective bargaining agreement 
infringement. The law prohibits public authorities, employers, or 
organizations from interfering, limiting, or preventing unions from 
organizing, developing internal regulations, and selecting 
representatives. Penalties were insufficient to deter violations, and 
employees must usually seek a court order to obtain reinstatement.</p>
<p>The government and employers generally respected the right of association and collective bargaining.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor. 
Nevertheless, there were reports such practices continued to occur, 
often involving Roma, persons with disabilities, and children. The 
government did not effectively enforce the law and took limited measures
 to prevent forced or compulsory labor. The law criminalizes forced 
labor, but penalties have been insufficient to deter violations.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 100 of the 497 victims
 of trafficking officially identified in 2018 were exploited 
specifically for labor purposes. Of these, 42 were trafficked for 
agricultural work and 26 victims were forced into begging.</p>
<p>Men, women, and children were subjected to labor trafficking in 
agriculture, construction, domestic service, hotels, and manufacturing. 
Organized rings, often involving family members, forced persons, 
including significant numbers of Romani women and children, to engage in
 begging and petty theft (see section 7.c.).</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits the worst forms of child labor. The minimum 
age for most forms of employment is 16. Children may work with the 
consent of parents or guardians at age 15 if the activities do not 
endanger their health, morality, or safety. The law prohibits persons 
younger than 18 from working in hazardous conditions, includes a list of
 dangerous jobs, and specifies penalties for offenders. Some examples of
 hazardous jobs for children include those posing a high risk of 
accident or damage to health, exposure to psychological or sexual risk, 
night shifts, exposure to harmful temperatures, and those requiring use 
of hazardous equipment. Parents whose children carry out hazardous 
activities are required to attend parental education programs or 
counseling and may be fined if they fail to do so.</p>
<p>Minors who work have the right to continue their education, and the 
law obliges employers to assist in this regard. Minors between the ages 
of 15 and 18 may work a maximum of six hours per day and no more than 30
 hours per week, provided their school attendance is not affected. 
Businesses that impose tasks incommensurate with minorsâ physical 
abilities or fail to respect restrictions on minorsâ working hours can 
face fines. Many minors reportedly did not attend school while working. 
Minors have the right to an additional three days of annual leave.</p>
<p>The law requires schools to notify social services immediately if 
children miss class to work, but schools often did not comply. Social 
welfare services have the responsibility to reintegrate such children 
into the educational system.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection may impose fines and 
close businesses where it finds exploitation of child labor. The 
National Authority for the Protection of the Rights of the Child and 
Adoption (ANPFDC) in the Labor Ministry has responsibility for 
investigating reports of child labor abuse, but enforcement of child 
labor laws tended to be lax, especially in rural areas with many 
agricultural households and where social welfare services lacked 
personnel and capacity to address child labor violations. The ANPFDC is 
responsible for monitoring and coordinating all programs for the 
prevention and elimination of child labor.</p>
<p>The government did not effectively enforce laws, and penalties were 
not sufficient to deter violations. Government efforts focused on 
reacting to reported cases, and the ANPFDC dedicated limited resources 
to prevention programs. According to the ANPFDC, 260 children were 
subject to child labor in 2018. The incidence of child labor was widely 
believed to be much higher than official statistics reflected. Child 
labor, including begging, selling trinkets on the street, and washing 
windshields, remained widespread in Romani communities, especially in 
urban areas. Children as young as five engaged in such activities, and 
cases were usually documented only when police became involved. Children
 whose parents work abroad remain vulnerable to neglect and abuse. In 
2018 a total of 92,027 children had at least one parent working abroad. 
In nearly a fifth of these cases, both parents were abroad. Of the 260 
documented cases of child labor in 2018, authorities prosecuted only one
 alleged perpetrator, while an additional 135 cases remained under 
investigation at the end of 2018.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>Labor laws and regulations prohibit discrimination with respect 
to employment and occupation because of race, sex, gender, age, 
religion, disability, language, sexual orientation or gender identity, 
HIV-positive or other communicable disease status, social status, or 
refugee or stateless status. The government did not enforce these laws 
effectively, reacting to claims of discrimination rather than adequately
 engaging in programs to prevent discrimination. Although the CNCD and 
the Labor Inspectorate investigated reported cases of discrimination, 
penalties were insufficient to deter violations.</p>
<p>Discrimination in employment or occupation occurred with respect to 
gender, disability, and HIV status. Discrimination against Roma and 
migrant workers also occurred. With respect to employment 
discrimination, the CNCD processed 365 cases in 2018 and 278 in the 
first half of the year. The CNCD addressed cases in both the public and 
private sectors.</p>
<p>According to Eurostat, the pay gap between men and women in the 
country was 3.5 percent in 2017. While the law provides female employees
 re-entering the workforce after maternity leave the right to return to 
their previous or a similar job, pregnant women and other women of 
childbearing age could still suffer unacknowledged discrimination in the
 labor market.</p>
<p>Although systematic discrimination against persons with disabilities 
did not exist, the public had a bias against persons with disabilities. 
NGOs worked actively to change attitudes and assist persons with 
disabilities to gain skills and employment, but the government lacked 
adequate programs to prevent discrimination. The law requires companies 
or institutions with more than 50 employees to employ workers with 
disabilities for at least 4 percent of their workforce or pay a fine for
 lack of compliance. Before the ordinance was adopted, the law allowed 
companies not in compliance with the quota to fulfill their legal 
obligation by buying products from NGOs or firms, known as âsheltered 
units,â where large numbers of persons with disabilities were employed. 
NGOs reported that sheltered units lost an important source of income as
 a result. Local labor offices had limited success in facilitating 
employment for persons with disabilities, finding employment for 402 
individuals in 2018 and 85 during the first quarter of the year.</p>
<p>NGOs reported that patients suffering from cancer and tuberculosis 
faced unacknowledged discrimination in the workplace. Almost one-third 
of employees with cancer reported they postponed informing their 
employer of their illness; after treatment, 17 percent reported a 
substantial reduction in job duties and responsibilities upon returning 
to work. The law supports tuberculosis patients by providing monthly 
food allowances, medical leave, and psychological support but does not 
contain measures to protect patients from workplace discrimination.</p>
<p>As authorities allow greater numbers of non-EU citizens to live and 
work in the country, reports of discrimination against migrant workers 
have become more prevalent. In Arad local workers went on strike in 
solidarity with their colleagues from India after a rail car 
manufacturer deducted the transportation costs from India to Romania as a
 lump sum from monthly wages without prior notice to the employees. 
After media reported that a major construction company in Bucharest 
housed many Vietnamese workers in unsuitable conditions, the company 
canceled their labor contracts, claiming the workers made public 
statements against company regulations and damaged its public image. The
 Health Inspectorate subsequently fined the company 45,000 lei ($11,000)
 for providing housing to non-EU workers that failed to meet sanitary

					<p>The law provides for a national minimum wage that is greater 
than the official estimate for the poverty income level. The minimum 
wage has nearly tripled in nominal terms since 2012. In addition a 
government decision issued in December 2018 introduced a differentiated 
minimum wage, decreeing that employees with a university degree and at 
least one year on the job must receive at least 13 percent more than 
other minimum wage workers earn. The government also introduced a 
significantly higher minimum wage for construction workers. Up to 60 
percent of employees earn the minimum wage according to the Labor 
Ministry. Authorities enforced wage laws adequately, although a 
significant informal economy existed. According to Eurostat data, in 
2018 nearly a third of the population (32.5 percent) was at risk of 
poverty or social exclusion. Despite minimum wage increases, nearly one 
in seven employed Romanians was at risk of poverty.</p>
<p>The law provides for a standard workweek of 40 hours or five days. 
Workers are entitled to overtime pay for weekend or holiday work or work
 of more than 40 hours. An employeeâs workweek may not exceed 48 hours 
per week on average over a four-month reference period, although 
exceptions are allowed for certain sectors or professions. The law 
requires a 48-hour rest period in the workweek, although most workers 
received two days off per week. During reductions in workplace activity 
for economic or technical reasons, the law allows employers to shorten 
an employeeâs workweek and reduce the associated salary. Excessive 
overtime may lead to fines for employers if workers file a complaint, 
but complaints were rare. The law prohibits compulsory overtime.</p>
<p>The law gives employers wide discretion regarding the 
performance-based evaluation of employees. The law permits 90-day 
probationary periods for new employees and simplifies termination 
procedures during this period.</p>
<p>The law provides for temporary and seasonal work and sets penalties 
for work performed without a labor contract in either the formal or the 
informal economy. In accordance with EU regulations, the maximum 
duration of a temporary contract is 36 months.</p>
<p>The Labor Ministry, through the Labor Inspectorate, is responsible 
for enforcing the law on working conditions, health and safety, and 
minimum wage rates, but it does not effectively enforce all aspects 
consistently. The inspectorate was understaffed and inspectors 
underpaid; consequently, the inspectorate had high turnover and limited 
capacity. Minimum wage, hours of work, and occupational safety and 
health standards were not effectively enforced in all sectors. The 
construction, agriculture, and small manufacturers sectors were 
particularly problematic sectors for both labor underreporting and 
neglecting health and safety standards. The Labor Inspectorate increased
 inspections in 2018, identifying 14,568 undeclared workers and fining 
employers 119.2 million lei ($29.8 million). Through June the Labor 
Inspectorate identified 5,004 undeclared workers and fined employers 
50.5 million lei ($12.6 million).</p>
<p>According to trade union reports, many employers paid supplemental 
salaries under the table to reduce both tax burdens for employees and 
employers alike. To address underreported labor, in 2017 the government 
increased the minimum required payroll taxes that employers must pay for
 their part-time employees to equal those of a full-time employee 
earning minimum wage. In addition the Labor Inspectorate collaborated 
with the National Authority for Fiscal Administration to conduct joint 
operations to check employers in sectors prone to underreported labor, 
including the textile, construction, security, cleaning, food 
preparation, transportation, and storage industries. These 
investigations often focused on underpayment of taxes rather than 
workersâ rights.</p>
<p>The government did not effectively enforce overtime standards. Union 
leaders complained that overtime violations were the main problem facing
 their members, since employers often required employees to work longer 
than the legal maximum without always receiving mandatory overtime 
compensation. This practice was especially prevalent in the textile, 
banking and finance, and construction sectors.</p>
