				<p>Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty republic. In 2014 voters
 elected Juan Manuel Santos president in elections that observers 
considered free and fair.</p>
<p>Civilian authorities generally maintained effective control over security forces.</p>
<p>The most significant human rights issues included extrajudicial and 
unlawful killings; reports of torture and arbitrary detention; 
corruption; rape and abuse of women and children by illegal armed 
groups; forced abortion carried out by illegal armed groups; and 
violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex 
persons. Violence against and forced displacement of Afro-Colombian and 
indigenous persons persisted, as did illegal child labor and killings 
and other violence against trade unionists.</p>
<p>The government took steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish 
officials who committed human rights abuses, including judges, mayors, 
and other local authorities.</p>
<p>The government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC),
 formerly the countryâs largest guerrilla insurgency group, continued to
 implement the November 2016 peace accord. The agreement provides for 
the creation of a Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation 
and Non-Repetition, including the establishment of a Special 
Jurisdiction for Peace (SJP, or JEP in Spanish) designed to investigate 
and ensure accountability for serious conflict-related crimes. The FARC 
completed its disarmament on August 15, and former members 
reincorporated as a political party on September 1. The government and a
 smaller guerrilla force, the National Liberation Army (ELN), announced 
on September 4 a temporary, bilateral ceasefire (the first-ever such 
agreement during the 50-year conflict with the ELN), which began on 
October 1 while peace talks continued. There were reports the ELN 
violated the agreement during the year. The ELN perpetrated armed 
attacks across the country for much of the year, mostly prior to the 
temporary ceasefire. In September the government received an offer from 
the Gulf Clan (formerly known as Clan Usuga or Los&nbsp;<em>Urabenos</em>),
 the countryâs largest criminal organization, to demobilize through a 
surrender (âsometimientoâ) process, or submission to justice. Illegal 
armed groups and drug trafficking gangs continued to operate, with 
approximately 2,900 members nationwide. Illegal armed groups, as well as
 narcotics traffickers, were significant perpetrators of human rights 
abuses and violent crimes and committed acts of extrajudicial and 
unlawful killings, political killings, extortion, kidnapping, torture, 
human trafficking, bombings and use of landmines, restriction on freedom
 of movement, recruitment and use of child soldiers, and intimidation of
 journalists, women, and human rights defenders.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were reports the government or its agents committed 
arbitrary or unlawful killings, and related investigations and 
prosecutions proceeded slowly (see section 1.g.).</p>
<p>For example, on October 5, at least seven persons, including two 
members of the Awa indigenous people, were killed and another 20 injured
 in the southwestern municipality of Tumaco, Narino Department, during a
 protest against government coca eradication operations, according to 
the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). Some eyewitnesses
 alleged that members of the antinarcotics police force fired their 
weapons into the crowd, while others alleged FARC dissidents first 
attacked the protesters and authorities, and that the security forces 
acted in self-defense. On October 10, the Minister of Defense announced 
the government would transfer 102 police officers out of Tumaco in an 
effort to restore public trust. Media reported the government suspended 
four police officers. The president ordered a prompt and thorough 
investigation. The vice president traveled to the region to oversee the 
investigation and the government response to community concerns. The 
IACHR urged authorities to investigate the events thoroughly and âto 
ensure the safety and integrity of the campesino, indigenous, and 
Afro-descendant communities.â</p>
<p>Nongovernmental monitors reported a decrease in extrajudicial 
killings and an overall reduction in violence. According to the National
 Police, between January 1 and October 25, there were 9,380 homicides 
and 69 terrorist attacks, compared with 9,850 homicides and 138 
terrorist attacks over the same period in 2016, a decrease they 
attributed to the implementation of the peace accord between the 
government and the FARC (see section 1.g.).</p>
<p>From January 1 through July, the Attorney Generalâs Office registered
 three new cases of alleged aggravated homicides by state agents. During
 the same period, authorities formally accused 19 members of the 
security forces and arrested three for aggravated homicide or homicide 
of a civilian, 16 of them for crimes that occurred prior to 2016. The 
Attorney Generalâs Office registered the arrest of eight members of the 
security forces in connection with homicides.</p>
<p>There were developments in efforts to hold officials accountable in 
false positive extrajudicial killings, in which thousands of civilians 
were killed and falsely presented as guerrilla combatants in the late 
1990s to late 2000s. As of March 15, the Attorney Generalâs Office 
reported 455 open investigations, 836 cases in the prosecution phase, 
and 238 cases in the sentencing phase related to false positive 
killings. The Attorney Generalâs Office reported that from 2008 through 
2016, it had reached convictions in 1,414 false positive cases, with 
defendants ranging up to the rank of colonel.</p>
<p>On April 3, Lieutenant Colonel Gabriel Rincon Amado and 20 soldiers 
under his command were convicted for their role in âfalse positiveâ 
killings in Soacha in 2008 and received sentences ranging from 38 to 52 
years in prison.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office reported that as of June, there were 
open investigations against 18 retired and active duty generals related 
to false positive killings, although no new investigations were opened 
in 2016 or 2017. The Attorney Generalâs Office reported investigations 
against two other generals were closed in 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office reported that the case against retired 
general William Henry Torres Escalante involving false positive killings
 was transferred to the special investigations unit in 2016, after a 
court upheld his indictment. Torres Escalante was granted conditional 
liberty on August 4 under the transitional justice mechanism of the 
peace accord. According to media reports, in December the Superior Court
 of Yopal revoked Torres Escalanteâs conditional liberty and ordered 
that he be rearrested. The court held that conditional liberty could 
only be granted once the Special Jurisdiction for Peace was operational.
 Media reported that retired general Mario Montoya Uribe was scheduled 
to appear before a judge to face charges related to false positive 
killings in 2016, but the hearing was postponed. The Attorney Generalâs 
Office reported the investigation of Montoya Uribe was in the 
preliminary investigation and inquiry phase as of June.</p>
<p>On November 14, Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a public statement 
alleging five army officers recommended for promotion were âcredibly 
linkedâ to false positive killings. HRW stated two of the five officers 
in questionâBrigadier General Francisco Javier Cruz Ricci, the then 
commander of the armyâs Sixth Division, and Colonel Miguel Eduardo David
 Bastidasâwere under investigation by the Attorney Generalâs Office for 
alleged involvement in false positive cases. According to HRW, General 
Cruz Ricci was under investigation for the killing of two civilians in 
July 2004, when he commanded the Ninth Special Energy and Roads Plans 
Battalion of the 27th Brigade. HRWâs statement further alleged that Juan
 Pablo Rodriguez Barragan, former commander of the armed forces, was 
under investigation for false positive extrajudicial killings allegedly 
committed under his command.</p>
<p>Subsequently, media reported David Bastidasâ name was removed from 
the promotion list after prosecutors sought his arrest in connection 
with the false positive extrajudicial killings of Uber Esneider Giraldo,
 Disney Villegas, and 30 other persons, as well as other crimes 
allegedly committed when he was second-in-command of the Fourth 
Artillery Battalion âJorge Eduardo Sanchez.â The Senate voted to approve
 the remaining promotions on December 5.</p>
<p>On September 13, an International Criminal Court (ICC) delegation, 
including Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, visited Bogota in the context
 of the ICCâs preliminary examination of the situation in Colombia. 
According to a public statement, the delegation sought to obtain 
information concerning the status of national proceedings related to 
false positive killings, as well as information about aspects of the 
future SJP, sexual and gender-based crimes, and forced displacement.</p>
<p>On April 18, the then commander of the army General Alberto Jose 
Mejia Ferrero honored Sergeant Carlos Mora, a whistleblower in the false
 positives scandal. Mejia urged the armyâs leaders to hold themselves 
and their units to the highest standards of transparency and to respect 
human rights and international humanitarian law. In December the 
president elevated General Mejia to serve as armed forces commander, 
replacing Juan Pablo Rodriguez Barragan, who retired.</p>
<p>Human rights organizations, victims, and government investigators 
accused some members of government security forces of collaborating with
 or tolerating the activities of organized criminal gangs, which 
included some former paramilitary members.</p>
<p>Investigations of past killings proceeded, albeit slowly. The 
Attorney Generalâs Office reported that through July, it obtained three 
new convictions of security force members in cases involving homicide of
 a âprotected personâ (i.e., civilians and others accorded such status 
under international humanitarian law), four new convictions in cases 
involving aggravated homicide, and 11 new convictions in cases involving
 âsimple homicideâ committed by security force members. Of these 
sentences, 15 corresponded to cases that took place before 2017.</p>
<p>Illegal armed groups, including the ELN and narcotics traffickers, 
were significant perpetrators of violent crimes and committed unlawful 
killings (see section 1.g.).</p>
<p>The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
reported 73 social leaders were killed between January and December 20. 
For example, on June 7, Bernardo Cuero Bravo, a prominent human rights 
activist and Afro-Colombian community leader, was shot and killed in his
 home in Villa Esperanza, Atlantico. Bravo worked as an attorney for the
 National Association of Displaced Afrodescendants (AFRODES). The 
president addressed the attacks on social leaders at the one-year 
anniversary of the peace accord saying, âEvery murder, every attack, 
every threat hurts us,â and pledging to âprotect [social] leaders and to
 capture those responsible.â</p>
<p>The IACHR held a public hearing at the request of the government on 
âInvestigation of Attacks on Human Rights Defenders in Colombiaâ during 
its 161st Period of Sessions in March. Civil society organizations that 
participated urged the government to investigate and address the root 
causes of violence against social and ethnic leaders. The deputy 
attorney general provided updates on progress in cases of human rights 
defenders killed in 2016 and 2017, stating that, of 74 individuals that 
had been linked to the killings, 58 persons had been arrested, four had 
been sentenced, and six were on trial. According to the Attorney 
Generalâs Office, of 118 cases in 2016 and 2017, 59 showed procedural 
advances. The Attorney Generalâs Office Special Investigation Unit 
provided for in the peace accord was established. The focus of the unit 
was on investigating and prosecuting criminal organizations and their 
support networks.</p>
<p>On November 30, the Minister of Defense attributed the delay in 
investigating and prosecuting killings of social leaders to difficulty 
in determining motive and delays in reaching the remote crime scenes. He
 announced a rapid response mechanism that he stated would ensure a 
combined security force/Attorney Generalâs Office response within two 
hours to any attack on a social leader, anywhere in the country.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Disappearance</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports of disappearances by or on behalf of 
government authorities. From January 1 through the end of July, however,
 a total of 3,957 persons were registered as missing, including 79 
persons believed to be victims of forced disappearances. The National 
Institute of Forensic Medicine and Forensic Science reported that from 
1938 to 2016, a total of 120,104 cases of disappearances were 
registered, including 25,102 cases of forced disappearances. The 
government did not provide information on the number of victims of 
forced disappearances who were located nor a disaggregation of the 
number found alive or dead.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office indicated that between January 1 and 
July 31, there were no new convictions of members of the security forces
 involved in forced disappearances cases.</p>
<p>As part of a peace process confidence-building measure, the FARC 
agreed in 2015 to search for those missing in the conflict. The 
government agreed to accelerate the identification of anonymous victims 
killed in security operations and extrajudicial killings and to turn 
over their remains to family members. The parties also agreed to create a
 new search unit for the missing, which was established in April by 
presidential decree 589 and would receive technical support from the 
international community.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>Although the law prohibits such practices, under articles 137 
and 178 of the criminal code, there were reports government officials 
committed abuses. The nongovernmental organization (NGO) Center for 
Research and Education of the Populace (CINEP) reported that through 
June 30, security forces were allegedly involved in 17 cases of torture,
 four committed by the National Prison Institute (INPEC) and 13 by the 
National Police. Members of the military and police accused of torture 
generally were tried in civilian rather than military courts.</p>
<p>Between January 1 and July 31, the Attorney Generalâs Office charged 
five members of the police force with torture; all the cases occurred 
prior to 2017. During the same period, the Attorney Generalâs Office 
reported four convictions of members of the security forces and one 
conviction of a member of an illegal armed group in a case of torture.</p>
<p>CINEP reported criminal bands were responsible for five documented 
cases of torture through June 30. In 11 other documented cases, CINEP 
was not able to identify the party responsible for the abuses.</p>
<p>According to NGOs monitoring prison conditions, there were numerous 
allegations of sexual and physical violence committed by guards and 
other inmates.</p>
<h4>Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h4>
<p>With the exception of new facilities, prisons and detention centers 
were overcrowded, lacked adequate sanitation, and provided poor health 
care and other basic services. Poor training of officials remained a 
problem throughout the prison system.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: INPEC, which operated the national 
prisons and oversaw the jails, estimated there were 115,950 persons 
incarcerated in 136 prisons across the country, of whom 19,167 were in 
pretrial detention. Overcrowding existed in menâs as well as in womenâs 
prisons. INPEC cited several prisons in Cali, Santa Marta, Valledupar, 
Itagui, and Apartado that were more than 200 percent overcrowded. INPEC 
reported 48 percent of federal prisons were overcrowded.</p>
<p>The law prohibits holding pretrial detainees with convicted 
prisoners, although this sometimes occurred. The Superior Judiciary 
Council stated the maximum time that a person may remain in judicial 
detention facilities is three days. The same rules apply to jails 
located inside police stations. These regulations were often violated.</p>
<p>The practice of preventive detention, in combination with 
inefficiencies in the judicial system, continued to exacerbate 
overcrowding. In July the government began to implement new procedures 
that provide for the immediate release of some pretrial detainees, 
including many accused of serious crimes such as aggravated robbery and 
sexual assault.</p>
<p>The Inspector Generalâs Office continued to investigate allegations 
that some prison guards routinely used excessive force and treated 
inmates brutally. No further information was available at yearâs end 
regarding the status of the 54 investigations opened in 2016.</p>
<p>Many prisoners continued to face difficulties receiving adequate 
medical care. Nutrition and water quality were deficient and contributed
 to the overall poor health of many inmates. Inmates claimed authorities
 routinely rationed water in many facilities.</p>
<p>INPECâs physical structures were in generally poor repair. The 
Inspector Generalâs Office noted some facilities had poor ventilation 
and overtaxed sanitary systems. Prisoners in some high-altitude 
facilities complained of inadequate blankets and clothing, while 
prisoners in tropical facilities complained that overcrowding and 
insufficient ventilation contributed to high temperatures in prison 
cells. Some prisoners slept on floors without mattresses, while others 
shared cots in overcrowded cells.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: Prisoners generally could submit complaints to
 judicial authorities, request investigations of inhuman conditions, and
 request that third parties from local NGOs or government entities, such
 as the Ombudsmanâs Office, represent them in legal matters and aid them
 in seeking an investigation of prison conditions. Authorities 
investigated prisoner complaints of inhuman conditions, including 
complaints of prison guards soliciting bribes from inmates, but some 
prisoners asserted the investigations were slow and the results were not
 accessible to the public.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: The government permitted independent 
monitoring of prison conditions by local and international human rights 
groups. INPEC required a three-day notice before granting consular 
access. Some NGOs complained that authorities, without adequate 
explanation, denied them access to visit prisoners.</p>
<p><u>Improvements</u>: During the year the Attorney Generalâs Office 
assigned 27 additional prosecutors to units aimed at preventing 
noncriminal cases from entering the criminal justice system, including 
prisons, thereby freeing up both prosecutors and judges to focus on 
genuine criminal cases.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention and provides 
for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness of his/her 
arrest or detention; however, there were allegations that authorities 
detained citizens arbitrarily. CINEP reported 45 cases of arbitrary 
detention committed by state security forces through June 30.</p>
<h4>ROLE OF THE POLICE AND SECURITY APPARATUS</h4>
<p>The Colombian National Police (CNP) is responsible for internal law 
enforcement and is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense. 
The Migration Directorate, part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is 
the immigration authority. The CNP shares law enforcement investigatory 
duties with the Technical Investigation Body. In addition to its 
responsibility to defend the country against external threats, the army 
shares limited responsibility for law enforcement and maintenance of 
order within the country. For example, military units sometimes provided
 logistical support and security for criminal investigators to collect 
evidence in high-conflict or remote areas. The government continued to 
expand education and training of the armed forces in human rights and 
international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>Some NGOs complained that military investigators, not members of the 
Attorney Generalâs Office, were sometimes the first responders in cases 
of deaths resulting from actions of security forces and might make 
decisions about possible foul play. By law the Attorney Generalâs Office
 is the main entity responsible for investigating allegations of human 
rights abuses committed by security forces. The government made 
improvements in investigating and trying abuses, but claims of impunity 
for security force members continued. This was due in some cases to 
obstruction of justice, opacity in the process by which cases are 
investigated and prosecuted in the military justice system, and a lack 
of resources for investigations. Inadequate protection of witnesses and 
investigators, delay tactics by defense attorneys, the judiciaryâs 
failure to exert appropriate controls over dockets and case progress, 
and inadequate coordination among government entities that sometimes 
allowed statutes of limitations to expireâresulting in a defendantâs 
release from jail before trialâwere also significant obstacles.</p>
<p>The military functions under both the old inquisitorial and a newer 
accusatory system. The military had not trained its criminal justice 
actors to operate under the accusatory system, which they were to begin 
to implement during the year. The military also had not developed an 
interinstitutional strategy for recruiting, hiring, or training 
investigators, crime scene technicians, or forensic specialists, which 
is required under the accusatory system. As such the military justice 
system did not exercise criminal investigative authority; all new 
criminal investigations duties are conducted by judicial police 
investigators from the CNP and Corps of Technical Investigators.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office reported open investigations into 18 
retired and active duty generals for alleged involvement in false 
positive extrajudicial killings (see section 1.a.).</p>
<h4>ARREST PROCEDURES AND TREATMENT OF DETAINEES</h4>
<p>Authorities must bring detained persons before a judge within 36 
hours to determine the validity of the detention, bring formal charges 
within 30 days, and start a trial within 90 days of the initial 
detention. Public defenders contracted by the Office of the Ombudsman 
assisted indigent defendants. Detainees received prompt access to legal 
counsel and family members as provided for by law. Authorities generally
 respected these rights.</p>
<p><u>Arbitrary Arrest</u>: The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and 
detention; however, this requirement was not always respected. NGOs 
characterized some arrests as arbitrary detention: arrests allegedly 
based on tips from informants about persons linked to guerrilla 
activities, detentions by members of the security forces without a 
judicial order, detentions based on administrative authority, detentions
 during military operations or at roadblocks, large-scale detentions, 
and detentions of persons while they were âexercising their fundamental 
rights.â</p>
<p><u>Pretrial Detention</u>: The judicial process moved slowly, and the
 civilian judicial system suffered from a significant backlog of cases, 
which led to large numbers of pretrial detainees. The failure of many 
local military commanders and jail supervisors to keep mandatory 
detention records or follow notification procedures made accounting for 
all detainees difficult. INPEC estimated that 19,167 prisoners, or 17 
percent of the countryâs prison inmates, were being held in pretrial 
detention. In some cases detainees were released without a trial because
 they had already served more than one-third of the maximum sentence for
 their charges.</p>
<p>Civil society groups complained that authorities subjected some community leaders to extended pretrial detention.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for an independent judiciary, and the 
government generally respected judicial independence and impartiality. 
Much of the judicial system was overburdened and inefficient, however, 
and subornation, corruption, and intimidation of judges, prosecutors, 
and witnesses hindered judicial functioning.</p>
<p>The government continued efforts to investigate, prosecute, and 
punish perpetrators of abuses, including public officials and members of
 the security services. Despite governmental improvements, the system 
struggled to close out cases quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The Inspector Generalâs Office conducts disciplinary investigations 
into allegations of misconduct by public employees, including members of
 government security forces. In addition to conducting its own 
investigations, the Inspector Generalâs Office referred all cases of 
human rights violations it received to the attorney generalâs Human 
Rights Unit for separate criminal proceedings. No further information 
was available at yearâs end regarding the status of disciplinary 
processes against members of the armed forces and police for alleged 
offenses.</p>
<h4>TRIAL PROCEDURES</h4>
<p>The constitution and law provide for the right to a fair and public 
trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. While
 the government began implementing an accusatory system of justice in 
2008, the use of delay tactics by defense lawyers to slow or impede 
proceedings, prosecutorsâ heavy caseloads, and other factors diminished 
the anticipated increased efficiencies and other benefits of adopting 
the adversarial model. Under the existing criminal procedure code, the 
prosecutor presents an accusation and evidence before an impartial judge
 at an oral, public trial. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and have the right to confront the 
trial evidence and witnesses against them, present their own evidence, 
and communicate with an attorney of their choice (or have one provided 
at public expense). Defendants have adequate time and facilities to 
prepare their defense. Defendants are not compelled to testify or 
confess guilt and have the right to appeal their proceedings. Although 
defendants have the right to an interpreter, the court system lacked 
interpreters for less commonly encountered languages. Crimes committed 
before 2008 are processed under the prior written inquisitorial system 
in which the prosecutor is a magistrate who investigates, determines 
evidence, and makes a finding of guilt or innocence. In those cases the 
trial consists of the presentation of evidence and finding of guilt or 
innocence to a judge for ratification or rejection.</p>
<p>In the military justice system, military judges preside over 
courts-martial. Counsel may represent the accused and call witnesses, 
but most fact finding takes place during the investigative stage. 
Military trial judges issue rulings within eight days of a court-martial
 hearing. Representatives of the civilian Inspector Generalâs Office are
 required to be present at courts-martial.</p>
<p>Criminal procedure within the military justice system includes 
elements of the inquisitorial and accusatory systems. The law provides 
for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally 
enforced this right. Defendants are considered innocent until proven 
guilty and have the right to timely consultation with counsel.</p>
<h4>POLITICAL PRISONERS AND DETAINEES</h4>
<p>The government declared that it did not hold political prisoners; 
nevertheless, authorities held some members of human rights advocacy 
groups on charges of conspiracy, rebellion, or terrorism, which the 
groups described as government harassment against human rights 
advocates. According to INPEC, the government held a total of 427 
pretrial and 545 convicted detainees on charges of rebellion or of 
aiding and promoting insurgency. The government provided the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) regular access to these 
prisoners.</p>
<h4>CIVIL JUDICIAL PROCEDURES AND REMEDIES</h4>
<p>Citizens may sue a government agent or entity in the Administrative 
Court of Litigation for damages resulting from a human rights violation.
 Although critics complained of delays in the process, the court 
generally was considered impartial and effective. Cases involving 
violations of an individualâs human rights may be submitted through 
petitions by individuals or organizations to the IACHR, which in turn 
may submit the case to the Inter-American Court on Human Rights. The 
court may order civil remedies, including fair compensation to the 
individual injured.</p>
<h4>PROPERTY RESTITUTION</h4>
<p>The 2011 Victimsâ and Land Restitution Law (Victimsâ Law) continued 
to provide a legal basis for assistance and reparations to persons, 
including victims of government abuses, but the government admitted that
 the pace of restitution was slow. The Administrative Department for 
Social Prosperity (DPS) handles problems related to victims, poverty, 
consolidation, historical memory, and protection of children and 
adolescents. Through July 31, a total of 8,504,127 victims registered 
with the Victimsâ Unit of the DPS. Of these, 7,243,838 were victims of 
forced displacement, with 360,325 registered during 2016, the latest 
date for which information was available. The government did not provide
 information on the number of those registered who received some form of
 assistance. Both individual and collective reparations are mandated by 
the Victimsâ Law; however, the original budget for implementation of the
 law contemplated only 4.5 million victims. The Land Restitution Unit, a
 semiautonomous entity in the Ministry of Agriculture, is responsible 
for returning land to displaced victims of conflict.</p>
<p>The Land Restitution Unit reported that it reviewed 148 requests for 
collective restitution of ethnic territories and 106,833 individual 
restitution claims, of which 8,551 were awaiting final judicial 
decision. The claims encompassed more than 12 million acres benefitting 
52,017 families. Of the 106,833 individual cases received through July 
3, a total of 3,285 belonged to individuals who self-identified as 
Afro-Colombian, 1,992 belonged to individuals who self-identified as 
indigenous, and 654 belonged to individuals who self-identified as 
belonging to other ethnic groups.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Arbitrary or Unlawful Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits such actions, but there were allegations that 
the government failed to respect these prohibitions. Government 
authorities generally need a judicial order to intercept mail or email 
or to monitor telephone conversations, including in prisons. Government 
intelligence agencies investigating terrorist organizations sometimes 
monitored telephone conversations without judicial authorization; the 
law bars evidence obtained this way from being used in court.</p>
<p>On September 11, Jorge Aurelio Noguera, the former director of the 
dismantled Administrative Department of Security (DAS), was sentenced to
 seven years in prison for engaging in illegal monitoring activities 
against human rights defenders, journalists, and civil society 
organizations during former president Uribeâs administration.</p>
<p>As of July the Attorney Generalâs Office initiated one new criminal 
investigation of government agents for illegal monitoring activities.</p>
<p>The Inspector Generalâs investigation continued into journalist Vicky
 Davilaâs accusations that police had been monitoring her 
communications, including trailing and wiretapping her and her reporting
 team, since 2014.</p>
<p>An investigation continued into abuses by the Army Intelligence Unit, known by its code name âAndromeda.â In 2016&nbsp;<i>Semana</i>&nbsp;magazine
 alleged the unit illegally wiretapped personal telephones of peace 
negotiators belonging to both the government and FARC negotiating teams.
 General Mauricio Forero, former head of the militaryâs intelligence 
center, left the army in 2016 due to alleged connections to Andromeda. 
As of 2016 he had not been charged or arrested in connection with these 
allegations.</p>
<p>There were no developments regarding the case of Martha Ines Leal, 
former DAS director of operations; Jorge Lagos, former DAS intelligence 
director; and Fernando Tabares, former DAS counterintelligence director,
 who submitted to the IACHR allegations that the Attorney Generalâs 
Office placed undue pressure on them in order to coerce them into 
testifying in the DAS illegal surveillance case. DAS allegedly engaged 
in illegal surveillance of high-court magistrates, journalists, human 
rights organizations and activists, opposition leaders, and the vice 
presidency.</p>
<p>In its annual report published in March, the OHCHR registered 72 
complaints of illegal surveillance and robbery of information of human 
rights defenders and social activists in 2016. While statistics for 2017
 were unavailable as of yearâs end, NGOs continued to accuse domestic 
intelligence or security entities of spying on lawyers and human rights 
defenders, threatening them, and breaking into their homes or offices to
 steal information.</p>
<p>The government continued to use voluntary civilian informants to 
identify terrorists, report terrorist activities, and gather information
 on criminal gangs. Some national and international human rights groups 
criticized this practice as subject to abuse and a threat to privacy and
 other civil liberties. The government maintained that the practice was 
in accordance with the âprinciple of solidarityâ outlined in the 
constitution and that the Comptroller Generalâs Office strictly 
regulated payments to such informants.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">g. Abuses in Internal Conflicts</h3>

					
					<p>The government and the FARC continued to implement the November 
2016 peace accord during the year. The FARC completed its disarmament on
 August 15, and former members reincorporated as a political party on 
September 1. Other observers contended the establishment of transitional
 justice mechanisms was proceeding slowly and that there was no 
coordinated plan for the collective reintegration of the FARC. Despite 
the peace accord with the FARC, an estimated 800 to 1,500 FARC dissident
 members were not participating in the peace process.</p>
<p>Illegal armed groups, dissident FARC members, and the ELN attempted 
to take over narcotrafficking networks vacated by the FARC, according to
 an October report by the International Crisis Group entitled&nbsp;<i>Colombiaâs Armed Groups Battle for the Spoils of Peace</i>.</p>
<p>The ELN, a smaller leftist guerilla force of approximately 3,400 
armed combatants and militia, continued to commit crimes and acts of 
terror throughout the country. On September 4, the government and the 
ELN announced a temporary, bilateral ceasefire scheduled from October 1 
through January 9, 2018. On September 29, the ELN ordered its members to
 implement the ceasefire. Under the ceasefire the ELN committed to stop 
hostage taking, attacks on infrastructure including oil pipelines, the 
use of land mines, and the recruitment of minors, while the government 
committed to improve protection for community leaders, improve 
conditions of detention for 450 rebels, and participate in a Monitoring 
Verification Mechanism together with representatives of the ELN, United 
Nations, and Catholic Church. There were reports the ELN may have 
violated the agreement during the year. Prior to the ceasefire, the ELN 
carried out bombings in Bogota and attacks in rural areas, causing a 
spike in violent attacks against military and police facilities.</p>
<p>There was a reduction in overall violence, which observers attributed
 to the implementation of the peace accord between the government and 
the FARC and the temporary bilateral ceasefire with the ELN. In 2016 the
 Conflict Analysis Research Center (CERAC) reported levels of violence 
in the country fell to their lowest in 52 years in terms of the number 
of victims, combatants killed and injured, and the number of other 
violent acts. CERAC estimated the ceasefire and implementation of the 
accord prevented the deaths of nearly 2,800 persons between mid-2016 and
 July 2017.</p>
<p>Illegal armed groups and drug gangs such as the Gulf Clan continued 
to operate. The Colombia-Europe-United States Coordination Group and 
other NGOs considered organized criminal bands to be a continuation of 
former paramilitary groups. The government acknowledged that some former
 paramilitary members were active in organized criminal gangs but noted 
the gangs lacked the national, unified command structure and explicit 
ideological agenda that defined past paramilitary groups, including the 
disbanded United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia.</p>
<p>In September the government received an offer from the Gulf Clan to 
demobilize through a surrender (âsometimientoâ) process, or submission 
to justice, but the effort did not progress. Illegal armed groups and 
drug trafficking gangs continued to operate with approximately 2,900 
members nationwide.</p>
<p><u>Killings</u>: The OHCHR registered three possible cases of 
âillegal deprivation of the right to lifeâ alleged to have been 
committed by security force members from January 1 through July 31. In 
several cases military officials stated they believed an individual was 
fighting on behalf of the ELN, while community members claimed the 
victim was not a combatant. In other cases military officials stated the
 killings were military mistakes. For example, on April 9, the OHCHR 
received a report alleging that members of the army had killed Eduardo 
Antonio Gutierrez, a road worker building a new road in the municipality
 of Morales. Security forces claimed, without providing evidence, that 
Gutierrez was a member of the ELN.</p>
<p>Conflicting reports indicated security forces may have fired on 
unarmed persons, killing at least seven, in Tumaco on October 5 (see 
section 1.a.).</p>
<p>According to authorities, 69 terrorist actions were reported between 
January and September. Guerrillas, notably the ELN, committed unlawful 
killings.</p>
<p>For example, on February 19, a bomb in downtown Bogota killed one 
police officer and wounded 24 others, along with two civilians. The ELN 
claimed responsibility for the attack, which took place one week after 
the ELN began peace talks with the government.</p>
<p>On June 17, a bomb at a shopping center in Bogota killed three 
persons in what authorities described as a terrorist attack, part of a 
surge in clashes between security forces and rebel groups. National 
Police later arrested eight members of the Peopleâs Revolutionary 
Movement rebel group in connection with the attack.</p>
<p>On October 1, three police officers were killed in an assault on a 
rural area in the municipality of Miranda, department of Cauca. Police 
suspected FARC dissidents of perpetrating the attack.</p>
<p>Organized criminal groups (some of which included former members of 
paramilitary groups) committed numerous political and unlawful killings,
 primarily in areas under dispute with guerrillas or without a strong 
government presence.</p>
<p>Organized criminal gangs and guerrilla groups killed, threatened, and
 displaced educators and their families for political and financial 
reasons, often because teachers represented the only government presence
 in the remote areas where the killings occurred. For example, on 
September 10, in Guaviare Department, unknown persons killed student and
 social leader Ivan Torres Acosta after he received threats issued 
through pamphlets encouraging him to stop his work with youth; media 
reports alleged FARC dissidents were responsible.</p>
<p>Civil society observers raised concerns inadequate security 
guarantees were facilitating the killing of former FARC militants in 
retaliation for revealing information about trafficking networks as part
 of the peace agreement. For example, according to the United Nations, 
from April through December, 34 former FARC members and 13 of their 
family members were killed. The Attorney Generalâs Office was 
investigating the cases. According to the United Nations, there was one 
conviction and arrests in three additional cases.</p>
<p><u>Abductions</u>: The ELN, organized criminal gangs, and common 
criminals continued to kidnap persons, both for ransom and for political
 reasons. For example, on July 22, the ELN kidnapped Carlos Omar 
Delgado, former mayor of Toledo, Norte de Santander; Delgado was freed 
on August 25. In June ELN forces kidnapped a Dutch couple in Norte de 
Santander.&nbsp;<i>El Tiempo</i>&nbsp;newspaper also reported the 
kidnapping of 12 merchants and the killing of four members of the 
security forces in Arauca Department during the year.</p>
<p>The United Action Groups for Personal Liberty reported 132 
kidnappings during the year, 31 fewer than in 2016. The same 
organization reported 25 hostages were freed through July. It also 
estimated criminal groups committed 83 percent of the kidnappings and 
that the ELN committed 13 percent; in the remaining 4 percent, it was 
not able to identify the party responsible. On October 4, the Ministry 
of Defense reported kidnappings had declined from 166 cases in 2016 to 
149 during the year.</p>
<p><u>Physical Abuse, Punishment, and Torture</u>: CINEP reported 
criminal bands were responsible for five documented cases of torture. In
 11 other documented cases, CINEP was not able to identify the party 
responsible for the abuses.</p>
<p>According to the NGO Landmine Monitor, nonstate actors, particularly 
the ELN, planted improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and land mines. 
Ecopetrol reported on March 29 that guerrillas continued to surround 
targeted areas with antipersonnel mines and to attack members of the 
armed forces assigned to secure its pipelines. The Cano Limon-Covenas 
pipeline was attacked 45 times during the year.</p>
<p><u>Child Soldiers</u>: There were reports the ELN and other illegal 
armed groups recruited persons under age 18. In February 2016 the FARC 
announced it would stop recruiting minors under the age of 18. There 
were no reports during the year that the FARC violated this commitment.</p>
<p><u>Other Conflict-related Abuses</u>: During the year reports of 
other human rights abuses occurred in the context of the conflict and 
narcotics trafficking. Drug traffickers, guerrilla fighters, and other 
illegal armed groups continued to displace predominantly poor and rural 
populations (see section 2.d., Internally Displaced Persons).</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-2" class="report__section-title">Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Speech and Press</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for freedom of expression, including for the 
press, and the government generally respected this right. Violence and 
harassment, as well as the criminalization of libel, inhibited freedom 
of the press, and the government frequently influenced the press, in 
part through its large advertising budgets. The independent media were 
active and expressed a wide variety of views without restriction.</p>
<p><u>Violence and Harassment</u>: According to the domestic NGO 
Foundation for Press Freedom (FLIP), through December 11, there were 302
 incidents of violence and harassment against journalists, including the
 killing of one journalist, although FLIP noted many other incidents 
might have gone unreported in the most dangerous areas of the country. 
During the same period, FLIP reported 128 threats, some aimed 
simultaneously at more than one journalist. FLIP also reported six 
journalists were illegally detained, 43 journalists were physically 
attacked, and 14 were stigmatized or harassed due to their work. 
According to FLIP, the justice sector brought to trial eight persons 
involved in four cases of violence against journalists, although 
investigations continued.</p>
<p>As of July the Human Rights Unit of the Attorney Generalâs Office was
 investigating 46 active cases of crimes against journalists. Eight 
cases were in the trial stage, and one person was convicted for such 
crimes.</p>
<p>On September 8, in the case of journalist Flor Alba Nunez Vargas, 
Juan Camilo Ortiz was sentenced to 47 years in prison, while Ortizâs 
alleged accomplice, Jaumeth Albeiro Florez, known by the alias âChori,â 
remained at large. The intellectual authors of the crime were unknown.</p>
<p>As of June 30, the National Protection Unit (NPU) provided protection
 services to 15 journalists. The NPUâs Protocol for Attention to Cases 
of Journalists and/or Social Communicators, issued in September 2016, 
aimed to provide more robust risk studies and meet the particular needs 
of this group. Some NGOs raised concerns about perceived shortcomings in
 the NPU, such as delays in protection being granted and in the 
appropriateness of measures to specific threats.</p>
<p><u>Censorship or Content Restrictions</u>: FLIP alleged that some 
journalists practiced self-censorship due to fear of being sued under 
libel laws or of being physically attacked, mostly by nongovernment 
actors. FLIP argued that the high degree of impunity for those who 
committed aggressions against journalists was also a factor.</p>
<p><u>Libel/Slander Laws</u>: By law slander and libel are crimes. There
 is no specific law against slandering public officials, and the 
government did not use prosecution to prevent media from criticizing 
government policies or public officials. Political candidates, 
businesspersons, and others, however, publicly threatened to sue 
journalists for expressing their opinions, alleging defamation or libel.
 FLIP reported no new cases were filed against journalists for libel or 
slander as of August 18, although 27 prosecutions of journalists for 
libel or slander continued from 2013.</p>
<p><u>Nongovernmental Impact</u>: Members of illegal armed groups sought
 to inhibit freedom of expression by intimidating, threatening, 
kidnapping, and killing journalists. National and international NGOs 
reported local media representatives regularly practiced self-censorship
 because of threats of violence from these groups.</p>
<h4>INTERNET FREEDOM</h4>
<p>The government did not restrict or disrupt access to the internet or 
censor online content, and there were no credible reports that the 
government monitored private online communications without appropriate 
legal authority. Due to the general climate of violence and impunity, 
self-censorship occurred both online and offline, particularly within 
communities at risk in rural areas.</p>
<p>The 2016 investigation continued into past abuses by the Army Intelligence Unit known as âAndromedaâ (see section 1.f.).</p>
<p>The International Telecommunication Union estimated 58 percent of the population used the internet in 2016.</p>
<h4>ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND CULTURAL EVENTS</h4>
<p>There were no government restrictions on academic freedom or cultural events.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association, and the government generally respected these rights.</p>
<h4>FREEDOM OF PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY</h4>
<p>The law provides for the freedom of peaceful assembly, and the 
government generally respected this right. Some NGOs alleged that riot 
police used excessive force to break up demonstrations. During a 
three-week strike in Buenaventura that began May 16 and concluded with 
the signing of an accord with the government on June 6, local social and
 human rights organizations accused the armed forces and National Police
 Anti-Riot Squad of using excessive force and alleged that at least 
1,300 demonstrators were injured.</p>
<h4>FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION</h4>
<p>The law provides for the freedom of association, and the government 
generally respected this right. Freedom of association was limited by 
threats and acts of violence committed by illegal armed groups against 
NGOs, indigenous groups, and labor unions.</p>
<p>Although the government does not prohibit membership in most 
political organizations, membership in organizations that engaged in 
rebellion against the government, espoused violence, or carried out acts
 of violence, such as FARC dissidents, the ELN, and other illegal armed 
groups, was against the law.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Freedom of Movement, Internally Displaced Persons, Protection of Refugees, and Stateless Persons</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign 
travel, emigration, and repatriation. The government generally respected
 these rights, although there were exceptions. Military operations and 
armed conflict in certain rural areas restricted freedom of movement.</p>
<p>The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in providing 
protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, refugees, 
returning refugees, asylum seekers, stateless persons, and other persons
 of concern.</p>
<p><u>In-country Movement</u>: There were no government restrictions on 
movement within the country. Organized criminal gangs, ELN guerrillas, 
and other illegal armed groups continued to establish illegal 
checkpoints on rural roads.</p>
<p>International organizations also reported that illegal armed groups 
confined rural communities through roadblocks, curfews, car bombs at 
egress routes, and IEDs in areas where narcotics cultivation and 
trafficking persisted. According to the UN Office for the Coordination 
of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), between January and October, more than 
105,000 persons faced mobility restrictions that limited their access to
 essential goods and services due to armed incidents and geographical 
factors. This reflected a 54 percent increase compared with 2016. 
Additionally, OCHA identified 25 events where humanitarian actors faced 
restrictions in access to communities by armed groups.</p>
<h4>INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS)</h4>
<p>The armed conflict, especially in remote areas, was the major cause 
of internal displacement. The government, international organizations, 
and civil society identified various factors driving displacement, 
including threats, extortion, and physical, psychological, and sexual 
violence by illegal armed groups against civilian populations, 
particularly women and girls. Competition and armed confrontation 
between and within illegal armed groups for resources and territorial 
control and confrontations between security forces, guerrillas, and 
organized criminal gangs, in addition to forced recruitment of children 
or threats of forced recruitment, were also drivers of displacement. 
Some NGOs asserted that counternarcotics efforts, illegal mining, and 
large-scale commercial ventures in rural areas also contributed to 
displacement.</p>
<p>The NGO Consultancy for Human Rights and Displacement (CODHES) 
reported 12,346 persons displaced from January through July 31. The NGO 
indicated the departments with the highest numbers of IDPs from mass 
displacements in the year were Choco (22 displacements), Antioquia (12 
displacements), Norte de Santander (10 displacements), and Narino (11 
displacements). CODHES also reported six land-rights leaders were killed
 and five land-rights claimants were killed from January 1 through July 
30.</p>
<p>As of July the NPU was providing protection services to 344 land-restitution leaders.</p>
<p>As of November 1, the government reported the Victimsâ Unit listed 
8,250,270 displaced in the Single Victims Registry, with registrants 
dating back to 1985. Victimsâ Unit statistics showed new displacements 
occurred primarily in areas where narcotics cultivation and trafficking 
persisted, especially where guerrilla groups and organized criminal 
gangs were present.</p>
<p>The Victimsâ Unit maintained the Single Victims Registry as mandated 
by law. Despite improvements in the government registration system, IDPs
 experienced delays in receiving responses to their displacement claims 
because of a large backlog of claims built up during several months. 
Government policy provides for an appeals process in the case of 
refusals.</p>
<p>The ELN and organized criminal gangs continued to use force, 
intimidation, and disinformation to discourage IDPs from registering 
with the government. Guerrilla agents sometimes forced local leaders and
 community members to demonstrate against government efforts to 
eradicate illicit crops and forced communities to displace as a form of 
coerced protest against eradication. International organizations and 
civil society expressed concern over urban displacement caused by 
violence stemming from territorial disputes between criminal gangs, some
 of which had links to larger criminal and narcotics trafficking groups.</p>
<p>The Victimsâ Unit cited extortion, recruitment by illegal armed 
groups, homicides, and physical and sexual violence as the primary 
causes of intra-urban displacement. UNHCR reported that in some 
departments displacement disproportionately affected indigenous and 
Afro-Colombian groups.</p>
<p>The National Indigenous Organization of Colombia estimated the number
 of displaced indigenous persons to be much higher than indicated by 
government reports, since many indigenous persons did not have adequate 
access to registration locations due to geographic remoteness, language 
barriers, or unfamiliarity with the national registration system.</p>
<p>The NGO AFRODES stated that threats and violence against 
Afro-Colombian leaders and communities continued to cause high levels of
 forced displacement, especially in the Pacific Coast region. AFRODES 
and other local NGOs repeatedly expressed concern that large-scale 
economic projects, such as agriculture and mining, contributed to 
displacement in their communities.</p>
<p>Fifty-two government agencies are responsible by law for assisting 
registered IDPs. International organizations and NGOs maintained that 
the quality of programs providing emergency assistance, shelter, and 
income generation needed strengthening. Emergency response capacity at 
the local level was weak, and IDPs continued to experience prolonged 
periods of vulnerability while waiting for assistance.</p>
<p>A specialized unit of the Attorney Generalâs Officeâestablished 
through an agreement with the governmentâs former social agency, Social 
Action (which the DPS replaced), the Attorney Generalâs Office, and the 
CNPâinvestigated cases of forced displacement and disappearances.</p>
<p>Dozens of international organizations, international NGOs, and 
domestic nonprofit groups, including UNHCR, International Organization 
for Migration, World Food Program, ICRC, and Colombian Red Cross, 
coordinated with the government to provide emergency relief and 
long-term assistance to displaced populations.</p>
<p>The Victimâs Unit was unable to provide humanitarian assistance for 
recent displacements until August due to contracting delays. 
International organizations and NGOs remained concerned about the slow 
and insufficient institutional response to displacement. As a result, 
NGOs took responsibility for providing humanitarian assistance to 
recently displaced individuals. International organizations and civil 
society reported that a continuing lack of local capacity to accept 
registrations in high-displacement areas often delayed by several weeks 
or months assistance to persons displaced individually or in smaller 
groups. Humanitarian organizations attributed the delays to a variety of
 factors, including the lack of personnel, funding, declaration forms, 
and training. Insecurity in communities affected by the conflict, 
including areas in the departments of Antioquia, Cauca, Choco, and 
Narino, sometimes delayed national and international aid organizations 
from reaching newly displaced populations.</p>
<p>Despite several government initiatives to enhance IDP access to 
services and awareness of their rights, in many parts of the country, 
municipalities did not have the resources or capacity to respond to new 
displacements and provide humanitarian assistance to IDPs. Many IDPs 
continued to live in poverty in unhygienic conditions and with limited 
access to health care, education, and employment.</p>
<p>Displaced persons also sought protection across international 
borders. UNHCR stated that Colombia was the country of origin for 
360,000 refugees and persons in a refugee-like situation, the majority 
in Ecuador, Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Panama. UNHCR estimated that 
between 400 and 500 Colombians crossed into Ecuador every month. The 
governments of Colombia and Ecuador continued to meet throughout the 
year regarding the situation of Colombian refugees in Ecuador, and the 
Colombian government offered a program to assist Colombian refugees in 
Ecuador who returned to Colombia.</p>
<h4>PROTECTION OF REFUGEES</h4>
<p><u>Access to Asylum</u>: The law provides for the granting of asylum 
or refugee status, and the government has established a system for 
providing protection to refugees. According to the government, it had 
approved 50 applications for refugee status since 2009. Between January 1
 and October 2, the government reported it received 400 new applications
 for refugee status, none of which was approved during the year. 
Venezuelans represented 85 to 90 percent of applications during the 
year. Authorities stated that the asylum process took at least one year,
 during which solicitants were given a permit to stay in the country but
 were not allowed to work.</p>
<p>Responding to increased migration flows, the government introduced in
 February registration for border mobility cards that allow Venezuelans 
the right to enter Colombia temporarily for family or business purposes.
 The cards do not afford bearers the right to travel beyond border 
areas, to work, or to reside in Colombia. As of October 31, more than 
1.2 million border cards had been issued to Venezuelans. In addition, 
the government established a âSpecial Residency Permitâ (PEP) to allow 
Venezuelans who had legally entered Colombia before July 28 to 
regularize their status and receive work authorization. As of October 
31, the last day to register for the PEP, approximately 79,000 PEPs had 
been issued.</p>
<p>The government reported a continuing rise in the smuggling of 
migrants from outside the region through Colombia en route to the United
 States and Canada. According to INTERPOL, as many as 34,000 migrants 
were detected in the country during the year. INTERPOL and migration 
officials reported most of the undocumented migrants were Haitians 
(20,366) and Cubans (8,167), followed by Africans and Asians, and that 
most entered through Ecuador, Venezuela, and Brazil. While the 
government generally provided access to the asylum process for persons 
who requested international protection, many abandoned their 
applications and continued on the migration route.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-3" class="report__section-title">Section 3. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides citizens the ability to choose their government
 through free and fair periodic elections held by secret ballot and 
based on nearly universal suffrage. Active-duty members of the armed 
forces and police may neither vote nor participate in the political 
process. Civilian public employees are eligible to vote, although they 
may participate in partisan politics only during the four months 
immediately preceding a national election.</p>
<p>As part of the peace accord, the government and the FARC agreed to 
take steps to register a political party comprised of former FARC 
members. The accord, which requires implementing legislation, guaranteed
 10 seats for FARC representatives in the Senate and House of 
Representatives in the 2018 and 2022 elections. It also provided for 
security guarantees for the new political party, state financing for the
 new partyâs 2018 and 2022 Senate and presidential campaigns, and access
 to media under the same conditions as other parties. On September 1, 
the FARC officially relaunched as a political party under the name 
Peopleâs Alternative Revolutionary Force (Fuerza Alternativa 
Revolucionaria del Comun), maintaining the same acronym.</p>
<h4>Elections and Political Participation</h4>
<p><u>Recent Elections</u>: In 2015 the country held departmental and 
local elections, involving 110,000 candidates running to be one of the 
countryâs 32 governors, 1,100 mayors, and more than 12,000 local council
 members. According to the NGO Foundation of Peace and Reconciliation, 
during the election period, seven candidates were killed, four were 
attacked, and 28 were threatened. The Electoral Observation Mission 
(MOE), an independent electoral monitoring NGO, reported that in the 
first seven months of the year, 49 public officials and political and 
social leaders were killed, 21 were victims of attacks, two were 
kidnapped, and 57 received death threats, for a total of 129 incidents 
of âpolitical and social violence.â</p>
<p>According to the MOE, electoral fraud remained a serious concern. The
 NGO Foundation of Peace and Reconciliation reported that in 2015 
parties paid voters to register and vote in municipalities in which they
 were not resident. In advance of the 2018 elections, the MOE estimated 
that the areas with the highest proportion of irregular voters were 
Meta, Vichada, and Vaupes. The government continued the use of a new 
finance tool to provide transparency of campaign funds, disqualified 
candidates with pending criminal investigations, and canceled the 
national identification cards of voters who could not demonstrate 
residence or employment in the municipality where they were registered 
to vote.</p>
<p><u>Political Parties and Political Participation</u>: Organized 
criminal gangs and the ELN threatened and killed government officials 
(see section 1.g.). As of August 22, the NPU, under the Ministry of 
Interior, provided protection to 1,891 persons, including members of 
departmental assemblies, council members, judges, municipal human rights
 officers, and other officials related to national human rights 
policies. By decree the CNPâs protection program and the NPU assume 
shared responsibility for protecting municipal and district mayors.</p>
<p><u>Participation of Women and Minorities</u>: No laws limit participation of women or members of minorities in the political process, and they did participate.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for official corruption, and
 the government generally implemented these laws effectively, although 
officials sometimes engaged in corrupt practices without punishment. The
 World Bankâs worldwide governance indicators reflected that government 
corruption was a serious problem. Revenues from transnational organized 
crime, including drug trafficking, exacerbated corruption.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: In June the top anticorruption official, Luis 
Gustavo Moreno Rivero, was arrested for alleged corruption. According to
 media reports, Moreno allegedly accepted a bribe from former Cordoba 
governor Alejandro Lyons, who was also facing charges related to alleged
 embezzlement of public funds during his time as governor. Related 
reporting linked Moreno to bribery cases involving members of the 
Supreme Court, including former court president Leonidas Bustos. On 
September 19, Francisco Ricaurte, former chief justice of the Supreme 
Court of Justice, was arrested for his alleged role in corruption. 
Investigations in the cases continued at yearâs end.</p>
<p>A special investigative unit of the Supreme Court of Justice, charged
 with investigating members of congress and senior government officials,
 reported that since January 1, the unit opened 56 investigations 
against former governors and 38 against sitting governors, and it 
reported one conviction in these cases.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office reported that for the year through July
 31, it had investigated 17 inspectors, six comptrollers, and 593 other 
senior government officials. In addition, as of July 31, the Attorney 
Generalâs Office was investigating 922 cases of corruption against 735 
public servants, of which seven were in the preliminary investigation 
phase and two had been brought to trial.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: By law public officials must file annual
 financial disclosure forms with the tax authority. The information is 
not made public. The law states that persons who intend to hold public 
office or work as contractors for the government for more than three 
months shall submit a statement of assets and income, as well as 
information on their private economic activity. The Administrative 
Department of Public Service is in charge of preparing the required 
forms, and the human resources chief in each entity is responsible for 
verifying the information submitted. Congress maintained a website on 
which members could voluntarily post their financial information.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A wide variety of domestic and international human rights groups
 generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
were typically cooperative and willing to listen to local human rights 
groupsâ concerns.</p>
<p>In a communique issued on December 20, the OHCHR reported 73 social 
leaders were killed between January and December (see section 1.a.). 
Several NGOs reported receiving threats in the form of email, mail, 
telephone calls, false obituaries, and objects related to death, such as
 coffins and funeral bouquets. The government condemned the threats and 
called on the Attorney Generalâs Office to investigate them. Some 
activists claimed the government did not take the threats seriously.</p>
<p>Through July 31, the Attorney Generalâs Office reported 34 active 
investigations and no convictions in cases of threats against human 
rights defenders.</p>
<p>As of June 30, the NPUâs 480 billion Colombian pesos (COP) ($160 
million) protection program provided protection to a total of 6,067 
individuals. Among the NPUâs protected persons were 575 human rights 
activists.</p>
<p>To help monitor and verify that human rights were respected 
throughout implementation of the peace accord, the government formally 
renewed the mandate of the OHCHR in 2016 for a period of three years. 
The accord requests that the OHCHR include a âspecial chapter on 
implementation of the agreements from the standpoint of human rightsâ in
 its annual reports.</p>
<p><u>Government Human Rights Bodies</u>: The ombudsman is independent, 
submits an annual report to the House of Representatives, and has 
responsibility for providing for the promotion and exercise of human 
rights. Ombudsman Carlos Alfonso Negret Mosquera was elected to serve a 
four-year term ending in August 2020. According to human rights groups, 
underfunding of the Ombudsmanâs Office limited its ability to monitor 
violations effectively. The ombudsman, as well as members of his 
regional offices, reported threats from illegal armed groups issued 
through pamphlets, email, and violent actions.</p>
<p>The National System for Human Rights and International Humanitarian 
Lawâled by a commission of 11 senior government officials and the vice 
presidentâdesigns, implements, and evaluates the governmentâs policies 
on human rights and international humanitarian law. The Office of the 
Presidential Advisor for Human Rights coordinates national human rights 
policy and actions taken by government entities to promote or protect 
human rights.</p>
<p>Both the Senate and House of Representatives have human rights 
committees that served as forums for discussion of human rights 
problems.</p>

					<h4>Women</h4>
<p><u>Rape and Domestic Violence</u>: Although prohibited by law, rape, 
including spousal rape, remained a serious problem. The law provides for
 sentences ranging from eight to 30 yearsâ imprisonment for violent 
sexual assault. For acts of spousal sexual violence, the law mandates 
prison sentences of six months to two years. By law femicide is 
punishable with penalties of 21 to 50 years in prison, longer than the 
minimum sentence of 13 years for homicide.</p>
<p>Violence against women, and impunity for perpetrators, continued to 
be a problem. Members of illegal armed groups, including former 
paramilitary members, and guerrillas also continued to rape and abuse 
women and children sexually.</p>
<p>The government continued to employ the Elite Sexual Assault 
Investigative Unit interagency unit in Bogota, which was dedicated to 
the investigation of sexual assault cases. Through the end of July, the 
Attorney Generalâs Office opened 14,249 investigations for sexual 
abuses.</p>
<p>The law requires the government to provide victims of domestic 
violence immediate protection from further physical or psychological 
abuse.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense continued implementing its protocol for 
managing cases of sexual violence and harassment involving members of 
the military.</p>
<p>The law augments both jail time and fines if a crime causes 
âtransitory or permanent physical disfigurement,â such as acid attacks.</p>
<p><u>Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C)</u>: The law prohibits FGM/C, but isolated incidents were reported in several indigenous communities.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Harassment</u>: The law provides measures to deter and 
punish harassment in the workplace, such as sexual harassment, verbal 
abuse or derision, aggression, and discrimination, which carries a 
penalty of one to three yearsâ imprisonment. Nonetheless, NGOs reported 
sexual harassment remained a pervasive and underreported problem.</p>
<p><u>Coercion in Population Control</u>: Coerced abortion was not 
permitted under the law, although the government reported illegal armed 
groups carried out forced abortions. Forced surgical sterilization of 
children with cognitive and psychosocial disabilities in certain cases 
is legal.</p>
<p>Through July 31, the Attorney Generalâs Office reported it opened 400
 investigations related to cases of forced abortion, 13 of which had 
occurred during the year. A two-year Attorney Generalâs Office 
investigation that concluded in 2016 documented 214 cases of girls who 
were subjected to rape, forced sterilization, forced abortion, and other
 forms of sexual violence by the FARC. In January, Spain extradited a 
Colombian manâHector Albeidis Arboleda, known as âthe Nurseââwho was 
accused of performing up to 500 forced abortions for the FARC between 
1998 and 2003. According to media reports, Arboleda was to be tried on 
various charges, including torture, homicide, attempted homicide, and 
forced abortion.</p>
<p>Estimates on maternal mortality and contraceptive prevalence are available at:&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201018144142/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/monitoring/maternal-mortality-2015/en/">www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/monitoring/maternal-mortality-2015/en/</a>.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: Although women have the same legal rights as 
men, serious discrimination against women persisted. The Office of the 
Advisor for the Equality of Women has primary responsibility for 
combating discrimination against women, but advocacy groups reported 
that the office remained seriously underfunded. The government continued
 its national public policy for gender equity.</p>
<h4>Children</h4>
<p><u>Birth Registration</u>: Citizenship is derived by birth within the
 countryâs territory. Most births were registered immediately. If a 
birth is not registered within one month, parents may be fined and 
denied public services.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: Child abuse was a serious problem. The ICBF 
reported 6,157 cases of sexual abuse against children in the first seven
 months of the year.</p>
<p><u>Early and Forced Marriage</u>: Marriage is legal at age 18. Boys older than 14 and girls older than 12 may marry with the consent of their parents.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: Sexual exploitation of 
children remained a problem. Sexual exploitation of a minor or 
facilitating the sexual exploitation of a minor carries a penalty of 14 
to 25 years in prison, with aggravated penalties for perpetrators who 
are family members of the victim and for cases of sexual tourism, forced
 marriage, or sexual exploitation by illegal armed groups. The law 
prohibits pornography using children under age 18 and stipulates a 
penalty of 10 to 20 years in prison and a fine. The minimum age for 
consensual sex is 14. The penalty for sexual activity with a child under
 14 ranges from nine to 13 years in prison. According to the ICBF, in 
2016 through July, there were 206 reported cases of commercial sexual 
exploitation of children.</p>
<p>Since 2009 the NGO Renacer Foundation certified 300 tourism-related 
businesses as committed to the fight against the sexual exploitation of 
children and adolescents. In cooperation with the government, Renacer 
trained 20,823 employees of these businesses in how to identify and 
fight sexual exploitation.</p>
<p><u>Displaced Children</u>: The NGO Consultancy for Human Rights and 
Displacement estimated in 2016 that 31 percent of persons registered as 
displaced since 1985 were minors at the time they were displaced (see 
also section 2.d.).</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is a party to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs&nbsp;<i>Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction</i>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201018144142/http://travel.state.gov/content/childabduction/en/legal/compliance.html">travel.state.gov/content/childabduction/en/legal/compliance.html</a>.</p>
<h4>Anti-Semitism</h4>
<p>The Jewish community, which had an estimated 5,000 members, continued
 to report instances of anti-Israeli rhetoric connected to events in the
 Middle East, accompanied by anti-Semitic graffiti near synagogues, as 
well as demonstrations in front of the Israeli embassy that were 
sometimes accompanied by anti-Semitic comments on social media. In 
particular, the Colombian Confederation of Jewish Communities expressed 
concern over the presence of BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) 
Colombia, which aggressively promotes the boycott of Israeli products, 
culture, and travel and does not actively counter the conflation of 
anti-Israeli policies with anti-Semitic rhetoric.</p>
<h4>Trafficking in Persons</h4>
<p>See the Department of Stateâs&nbsp;<i>Trafficking in Persons Report</i>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201018144142/http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/">www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/</a>.</p>
<h4>Persons with Disabilities</h4>
<p>The law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and 
mental disabilities but not sensory or intellectual disabilities. No law
 mandates access to information and telecommunications for persons with 
disabilities. A 2015 law punishes those who arbitrarily restrict the 
full exercise of the rights of persons with disabilities or harass 
persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>The Office of the Presidential Advisor for Human Rights under the 
High Counselor for Post-Conflict, Public Security, and Human Rights, 
along with the Human Rights Directorate at the Ministry of Interior, is 
responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities. 
According to Somos Defensores (We Are Defenders) and other NGOs, these 
laws were seldom enforced.</p>
<p>Although children with disabilities attended school at all levels, 
advocates noted the vast majority of teachers and schools were neither 
trained nor equipped to educate children with disabilities successfully.
 Advocacy groups also stated children with disabilities entered the 
education system later than children without disabilities and dropped 
out at higher rates. Persons with disabilities were unemployed at a much
 higher rate than the general population.</p>
<p>Forced surgical sterilization of children with cognitive and psychosocial disabilities in certain cases is legal.</p>
<p>In 2013 the State Council ordered all public offices to make 
facilities accessible to persons with disabilities and asked public 
officials to include requirements for accessibility when granting 
licenses for construction and occupancy. The State Council also asked 
every municipality to enforce rules that would make all public offices 
accessible to persons with disabilities âin a short amount of time.â</p>
<h4>National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities</h4>
<p>According to the most recent (2005) national census, approximately 
4.5 million persons, or 10 percent of the countryâs population, 
described themselves as being of African descent. A 2011 UN report 
estimated Afro-Colombians made up 15 to 20 percent of the population, 
while human rights groups and Afro-Colombian organizations estimated the
 proportion to be 20 to 25 percent.</p>
<p>Afro-Colombians are entitled to all constitutional rights and 
protections, but they faced significant economic and social 
discrimination. According to a 2016 UN report, 32 percent of the 
countryâs population lived below the poverty line, but in Choco, the 
department with the highest percentage of Afro-Colombian residents, 79 
percent of residents lived below the poverty line.</p>
<p>In 2010 the government approved a policy to promote equal opportunity
 for black, Afro-Colombian, Palenquera, and Raizal populations. 
(Palenquera populations inhabit some parts of the Caribbean coast, 
Raizal populations live in the San Andres archipelago, and Blacks and 
Afro-Colombians are Colombians of African descent who self-identify 
slightly differently based on their unique linguistic and cultural 
heritages.) The Ministry of Interior continued to provide technical 
advice and funding for social projects presented by Afro-Colombian 
communities.</p>
<p>The National Autonomous Congress of Afro-Colombian Community Councils
 and Ethnic Organizations for Blacks, Afro-Colombians, Raizales, and 
Palenqueras, consisting of 108 representatives, continued to meet with 
government representatives on problems that affected their communities.</p>
<h4>Indigenous People</h4>
<p>The constitution and law give special recognition to the fundamental 
rights of indigenous persons, who make up approximately 3.4 percent of 
the population (1,392,623 indigenous), and require the government to 
consult beforehand with indigenous groups regarding governmental actions
 that could affect them.</p>
<p>The law accords indigenous groups perpetual rights to their ancestral
 lands, but indigenous groups, neighboring landowners, and the 
government often disputed the demarcation of those lands. Traditional 
indigenous groups operated 710 reservations, accounting for 
approximately 28 percent of the countryâs territory. Illegal armed 
groups often violently contested indigenous land ownership and recruited
 indigenous children to join their ranks.</p>
<p>The law provides for special criminal and civil jurisdictions within 
indigenous territories based on traditional community laws. Legal 
proceedings in these jurisdictions were subject to manipulation and 
often rendered punishments more lenient than those imposed by regular 
civilian courts.</p>
<p>Some indigenous groups continued to assert that they were not able to
 participate adequately in decisions affecting their lands. The 
constitution provides for this âprior consultationâ mechanism for 
indigenous communities, but it does not require the government to obtain
 the consent of those communities in all cases.</p>
<p>The government stated that for security reasons it could not provide 
advance notice of most military operations, especially when in pursuit 
of enemy combatants, and added that it consulted with indigenous leaders
 when possible before entering land held by the communities.</p>
<p>Despite special legal protections and government assistance programs,
 indigenous persons continued to suffer discrimination and often lived 
on the margins of society. They belonged to the countryâs poorest 
population and had the highest age-specific mortality rates. As of the 
end of July, the Attorney Generalâs Office reported there were 17 active
 investigations of military members and members of the CNP accused of 
violating the rights, culture, or customs of indigenous groups.</p>
<p>Killings of members and leaders of indigenous groups remained a 
problem. Through September 1, the NGO National Indigenous Organization 
of Colombia reported 30 indigenous persons were killed. For example, on 
October 24, the ELN shot and killed indigenous governor Aulio Isarama 
Forastero in Choco.</p>
<p>Despite precautionary measures ordered by the IACHR, ethnic Wayuu 
children continued to die of malnutrition. NGOs and civil society 
leaders reported during the year that members of the Wayuu community 
received threats and were targeted by gunmen.</p>
<h4>Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h4>
<p>There was no official discrimination based on sexual orientation in 
employment, housing, statelessness, or access to education or health 
care. A 2015 Constitutional Court decision required that the Ministry of
 Education modify its educational materials to address discrimination 
based on sexual orientation or gender identity in schools. In May a 
proposed constitutional referendum to prevent same-sex couples from 
adopting failed in a congressional committee vote.</p>
<p>Transgender individuals cited barriers to public services when 
health-care providers or police officers refused to accept their 
government-issued identification. Some transgender individuals stated it
 was difficult to change the gender designation on national identity 
documents and that transgender individuals whose identity cards listed 
them as male were still required to show proof they had performed 
mandatory military service or obtained the necessary waivers from that 
service. NGOs claimed discrimination and violence in prisons against 
persons due to their sexual orientation and gender identity remained a 
problem.</p>
<p>Despite government measures to increase the rights and protection of 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons, there
 were reports of societal abuse and discrimination, as well as sexual 
assault. NGOs claimed transgender individuals, particularly transgender 
men, were often sexually assaulted in so-called corrective rape. The 
Constitutional Court pronounced in 2016 that transgender persons faced 
discrimination and social rejection within the LGBTI community and 
recommended measures to increase respect for transgender identities in 
the classrooms.</p>
<p>As of July 31, the Attorney Generalâs Office was investigating at 
least eight alleged homicides of LGBTI individuals that had occurred 
since January 1. Seven of the cases were in the investigation stage, and
 one was in the trial stage.</p>
<p>The NGO Colombia Diversa also reported three cases, involving four 
victims, of police abuse of persons due to their sexual orientation or 
gender identity, with the majority of complaints coming from transgender
 individuals. According to NGOs working on LGBTI problems, these attacks
 occurred frequently, but victims did not pursue cases due to fear of 
retaliation. NGOs also reported several cases of threats against human 
rights defenders working on LGBTI issues, as well as a high level of 
impunity for crimes against members of the LGBTI community. Such 
organizations partially attributed impunity levels to the failure of the
 Attorney Generalâs Office to distinguish and effectively pursue crimes 
against the LGBTI community.</p>
<p>The manual of administrative procedures for blood banks issued by the
 Ministry of Health states that, to protect the recipient of a 
transfusion from HIV/AIDS, the ministry excludes those donors who had 
âmale homosexual relations in the past 15 years.â In 2012 the 
Constitutional Court ordered the ministry to remove selection criteria 
based on the sexual orientation of donors, but the regulation reportedly
 was not changed as of September.</p>
<h4>HIV and AIDS Social Stigma</h4>
<p>There were no confirmed reports of societal violence or 
discrimination against persons with HIV/AIDS. In the most recent 
demographic and health survey (2010), the government reported the 
responses of 85 percent of those surveyed indicated discriminatory 
attitudes towards persons with HIV/AIDS, reflecting low levels of social
 acceptance throughout the country.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the right of workers to form and join 
unions, bargain collectively, and conduct legal strikes, and it 
prohibits antiunion discrimination. Members of associated workersâ 
cooperatives are not allowed to form unions, since the law recognizes 
members of a cooperative as owners. The law prohibits members of the 
armed forces and police from forming or joining unions. The law provides
 for automatic recognition of unions that obtain 25 signatures from 
potential members and that comply with a registration process. 
Public-sector employees legally have the right to bargain collectively. 
The government and employers generally respected freedom of association 
and collective bargaining in practice. Workers faced some obstacles to 
exercising those rights, and the government faced numerous challenges 
effectively enforcing applicable laws governing those two rights.</p>
<p>The law permits associated workersâ cooperatives (CTAs), collective 
pacts, and union contracts. Under collective pacts employers may 
negotiate accords on pay and labor conditions with workers in workplaces
 where no union is present or where a union represents less than 
one-third of employees. Law and regulations prohibit the use of CTAs and
 collective pacts to undermine the right to organize and bargain 
collectively, including by extending better conditions to nonunion 
workers through such pacts. Through a union contract, a company may 
contract a union, at times formed explicitly for this purpose, for a 
specific job or work; the union then in essence serves as an employer 
for its members. Workers who belong to a union that has a union contract
 with a company do not have a direct employment relationship with either
 the company or the union. Labor disputes for workers under a union 
contract may be decided through an arbitration panel versus labor courts
 if both parties agree.</p>
<p>The law does not permit members of the armed forces, police, and 
persons performing âessential public servicesâ to strike. Before 
conducting a strike, unions must follow prescribed legal procedures, 
including entering into a conversation period with the employer, 
presenting a list of demands, and gaining majority approval in the union
 for a strike. The law limits strikes to periods of contract 
negotiations or collective bargaining and allows employers to fire trade
 unionists who participate in strikes or work stoppages ruled illegal by
 the courts.</p>
<p>The government has the authority to fine labor-rights violators. The 
government sought to enforce most applicable labor laws, but a lack of 
an inspection strategy, as well as an overburdened judicial system, 
inhibited speedy and consistent application. The maximum penalty for 
violations of law, including those that prohibit the misuse of CTAs, is 
5,000 times the minimum monthly wage, or COP 3.4 billion ($1.13 
million). The law also stipulates that offenders repeatedly misusing 
CTAs or other labor relationships shall receive the maximum penalty and 
may be subject to losing their legal status to operate. Employers who 
engage in antiunion practices may also be imprisoned for up to five 
years, although government officials admitted a fine was more likely 
than imprisonment. Prohibited practices include impeding workersâ right 
to strike, meet, or otherwise associate, and extending better conditions
 to members of collective pacts than to union members. Through March the
 government reported fines on certain subcontracting entities for 
abusive forms of subcontracting at a value of COP 2.283 billion 
($761,000).</p>
<p>The Ministry of Laborâs Special Investigations Unit continued to 
exercise its power to investigate and impose sanctions in any 
jurisdiction. The vice minister for labor relations decides on a 
case-by-case basis whether to assign the Special Investigations Unit or 
the regional inspectors to investigate certain sites. The unit was 
reportedly overburdened with cases, resulting in denials of recent union
 requests for review by the unit.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor leads a tripartite Inter-Institutional 
Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Human Rights of 
Workers, with participation by the government, organized labor groups, 
and business community. The commission met in August.</p>
<p>As part of its commitments under the 2011 Colombian Action Plan 
Related to Labor Rights (Labor Action Plan), the government continued to
 take steps to protect internationally recognized labor rights. Labor 
inspections by the Ministry of Labor for abusive subcontracting in the 
five priority sectors of palm oil, sugar, ports, mines, and cut flowers 
remained infrequent, however. Critics claimed inspections lacked 
necessary rigor, assessed fines were not collected, and abusive 
subcontracting continued. The government continued to engage in regular 
meetings with unions and civil society groups.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor, in collaboration with the International Labor 
Organization (ILO), continued a virtual training program to prepare 
labor inspectors to identify antiunion conduct. It also implemented 
methods, including contract and process maps, as strategic planning 
tools to prioritize interventions. The ministry continued to employ a 
telephone- and internet-based complaint mechanism to report alleged 
labor violations. Union members complained that existing systems did not
 allow citizens to register anonymous complaints and noted that 
complaints registered through the telephone and internet systems do not 
result in action.</p>
<p>Judicial police, the Technical Investigation Body, and prosecutors 
investigating criminal cases of threats and killings are required to 
determine during the initial phase of an investigation whether a victim 
is an active or retired union member or is actively engaged in union 
formation and organization, but it was unclear whether they did so. It 
could take several months to transfer cases from regional field offices 
of the Attorney Generalâs Office to the Attorney Generalâs Human Rights 
Directorate, and cases are transferred only with the approval of the 
attorney general in response to direct requests, instead of 
automatically.</p>
<p>The government continued to include in its protection program for 
labor activists persons engaged in efforts to form a union, as well as 
former unionists under threat because of their past activities. Through 
July the NPU provided protection to 440 trade union leaders or members 
(others protected included journalists, human rights advocates, and land
 restitution claimants). Approximately 12 percent of the NPUâs budget 
was dedicated to unionist protection. Between January 1 and September 
30, the NPU processed 171 risk assessments of union leaders or members; 
96 of those cases were assessed as posing an âextraordinary threat,â and
 the NPU provided them protection measures. The NPU reported that 
through June, the average time needed to implement protection measures 
upon completion of a risk analysis was 50 days in regular cases or five 
days for emergency cases. NGOs, however, complained about slow 
processing times.</p>
<p>The protection and relocation of teachers falls under the Ministry of
 National Education and the departmental education secretaries, but the 
NPU retains some responsibilities for the risk analysis and protection 
of family members. Through July 31, the NPU evaluated 99 threat cases 
against teachers and found 62 to be of extraordinary risk.</p>
<p>In cases of unionist killings from previous years, the pace of 
investigations and convictions remained slow, and high rates of impunity
 continued. Labor groups stated more needed to be done to address 
impunity for perpetrators of violence against trade unionists and the 
large number of threat cases. The Attorney Generalâs Office indicated it
 prioritized cases in order of severity and had a backlog of 
lower-priority cases. As of July 31, the Attorney Generalâs Office 
reported 753 sentences against 620 persons in cases of violence against 
unionists since 2006 that were filed in the Human Rights Directorate. 
Between January 1 and July 31, the Attorney Generalâs Office reported 78
 sentences in cases of violence against union leaders.</p>
<p>Violence, threats, harassment, and other practices against trade 
unionists continued to affect the exercise of the right to freedom of 
association and collective bargaining. According to the Attorney 
Generalâs Office, through July 31, 166 teachers were registered as 
victims in cases of homicide.</p>
<p>The National Union School (ENS), a labor rights NGO and think tank, 
reported 14 trade unionists were killed through August. ENS and other 
labor groups stated that focusing on killings alone masked the true 
nature and scope of the violence against labor activists. Labor groups 
noted that in some regions nonlethal violations continued to increase. 
ENS reported during the same period 94 death threats, four nonlethal 
attacks, nine arbitrary detentions and 16 cases of harassment, and one 
case of an illegal raid.</p>
<p>For example, in June unidentified gunmen killed Mauricio Velez Lopez,
 national vice president of the National Public University Workers Union
 (Sintraunal).</p>
<p>Unions cited multiple instances in which companies fired employees 
who formed or sought to form new unions. Some employers continued to use
 temporary contracts, service agencies, and other forms of 
subcontracting to limit worker rights and protections. Fines assessed by
 the government did little to dissuade violators because fines were 
often not collected. In the first eight months of the year, the 
government reported 1,211 workers benefited from 14 formalization 
agreements that the Ministry of Labor reached with employers in Bogota 
and the departments of Amazonas, Barrancabermeja, Caqueta, Casanare, 
Valle del Cauca, Cesar, Choco, Huila, Norte de Santander, Putumayo, 
Quindio, and Uraba.</p>
<p>Labor confederations and NGOs reported that business owners in 
several sectors used âsimplified stock corporationsâ (SAS), union 
contracts, foundations, or temporary service agencies in attempts to 
circumvent legal restrictions on cooperatives. While in theory SAS 
workers may exercise their right to organize and bargain collectively 
with SAS management, it appeared that in some cases the SAS had little 
or no control over the conditions of employment. The Ministry of Labor 
stated that an SAS, like any corporate structure, may be fined for labor
 violations if they occurred.</p>
<p>According to ENS, Indupalma, a large employer in the palm sector 
located in the municipality of San Alberto, Cesar Department, employed 
more than 1,500 workers through illegal cooperatives. This reportedly 
was the only company in the region that continued using labor 
intermediation with illegal cooperatives with no sanctions or corrective
 measures by the Ministry of Labor.</p>
<p>Metal and mineworkersâ union SINTRAIME reported that inspections for 
abusive subcontracting carried out by the Ministry of Labor at the 
Drummond coalmines were ineffective in safeguarding the freedom of 
workers to organize.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor. The 
government did not effectively enforce the law in all cases, and there 
continued to be reports that such practices occurred. The law prescribes
 punishments of 13 to 23 yearsâ imprisonment plus fines for forced labor
 violations.</p>
<p>There were reports ELN guerrillas and organized criminal gangs used 
forced labor, including forced child labor, in coca cultivation and 
illegal mining in areas outside government control as well as forced 
labor for criminal activity, such as extortion, in urban areas. The ICBF
 noted it was difficult to produce exact statistics on the number of 
children who participated in illegal armed groups due to the groupsâ 
clandestine nature. In February 2016 the FARC announced it would stop 
recruiting children under the age of 18. The FARC reached an agreement 
with the government in May 2016 on how to release minors already in the 
ranks and facilitate their reintegration. As of June 14, the FARC 
released 88 children, according to UNICEF. As part of a temporary 
bilateral ceasefire between the government and the ELN scheduled from 
October 1 to January 12, 2018, the ELN committed to stop the recruitment
 of minors.</p>
<p>Forced labor in other sectors, including organized begging, mining, 
agriculture, forced recruitment by illegal armed actors, and domestic 
service, also remained a serious problem. Afro-Colombians, indigenous 
Colombians, and inhabitants of marginalized urban areas were at the 
highest risk of forced labor, domestic servitude, forced begging, and 
forced recruitment.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law sets the minimum age for employment at 15 and for 
hazardous work at 18. Children 15 and 16 years of age may work no more 
than 30 hours per week, and children age 17 may work no more than 40 
hours per week. Children under 15 may work in arts, sports, or 
recreational or cultural activities for a maximum of 14 hours per week. 
In all these cases, working children and adolescents must have signed 
documentation filed by their parents and approved by a labor inspector 
or other local authority.</p>
<p>The law prohibits child workers from working at night or where there 
is a risk of bodily harm or exposure to excessive heat, cold, or noise. 
Hazardous work includes an extensive list of activities within 11 
occupational categories, including agriculture, hunting and forestry, 
fishing, mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction, transport 
and storage, health services, and defense, and subcategories identified 
as the âworst forms of child labor.â</p>
<p>The law authorizes inspectors to issue fines of up to 5,000 times the
 minimum monthly wage for labor law violations, including child-labor 
violations. A violation deemed to endanger a childâs life or threaten 
moral values may be punished by temporary or permanent closure of the 
establishment. Nationwide, labor inspectors are responsible for 
enforcing child labor laws. In 2014 the Ministry of Labor created the 
Child Labor Eradication Internal Working Group based in Bogota but with 
nationwide responsibilities to investigate cases of child labor and 
carry out activities to prevent child labor. It was unclear what actions
 this group took. Inspectors monitored the formal sector through 
periodic inspections, but an estimated 80 percent of all child labor 
occurred in the informal sector of the economy. Resources and training 
remained inadequate for effective enforcement.</p>
<p>Government agencies carried out several activities to eradicate and 
prevent exploitative child labor. With ILO assistance the government 
continued to improve cooperation among national, regional, and municipal
 governments through its national plan to eradicate child labor and 
protect working youth. It also continued to employ a monitoring system 
to register working children, although the system was not always 
regularly updated. The government also sought to reduce demand for child
 labor through public awareness and training efforts, often working with
 international and civil society organizations.</p>
<p>The government, through the Ministry of Labor, continued to follow 
the 2008 plan outlined in the National Strategy to Prevent and Eradicate
 the Worst Forms of Child Labor and Protect Young Workers. It also 
continued its roundtable discussion group, which included government 
representatives, members of the three largest labor confederations, and 
civil society. The group concentrated its efforts on formalizing an 
integrated registration system for information on child labor that would
 permit public and private entities to register information about child 
workers.</p>
<p>The government continued to combat illegal mining and formalize 
artisanal mining production, with goals including the elimination of 
child labor and forced labor. Regional ICBF offices were charged with 
leading efforts to combat child labor in mining at the local level, 
working with the Ministry of Labor and other government agencies to 
coordinate responses. The Department for Social Prosperity continued to 
implement the More Families in Action program to combat poverty through 
conditional cash transfers; it included a specific focus on addressing 
child labor. In interagency child labor meetings, the Ministry of Labor 
reported that whichever government presence was available in the 
areaâwhether police, the ICBF, teachers, or the DPSâattended to children
 found working in illegal mining operations. While all agencies had 
directives on how to handle and report child labor cases, it was unclear
 whether all cases were referred to the ICBF.</p>
<p>The ICBF continued to implement several initiatives aimed at 
preventing child labor, including producing an extensive section of its 
website designed specifically for young audiences to educate children on
 child labor, their rights, and how to report child labor. The Ministry 
of Labor continued its work with the Network against Child Labor, in 
which the ministry operates alongside member businesses that pledged to 
work within the network to prevent and eradicate child labor.</p>
<p>Child labor remained a problem in the informal and illicit sectors. 
In April the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) 
published the results of a 2015 survey of child labor that measured 
child labor during October-December 2014. DANE data noted that, of the 
11.1 million children between ages five and 17, an estimated one million
 worked outside the home (approximately 68 percent boys and 32 percent 
girls). The national rate of children who worked outside the home was 
7.8 percent, with 4.2 percent of children ages five to 14 working and 
19.8 percent of children ages 15 to 17 working. For the period of the 
study, 29.8 percent of the children who worked did not attend school. 
According to the study, 36.3 percent of child laborers in urban areas 
engaged in commerce, hotel, and restaurant work, while 36.6 percent of 
child laborers in rural areas engaged in agriculture, fishing, cattle 
farming, hunting, and forestry work; 47.2 percent of working children 
ages five to 17 did not receive payment.</p>
<p>Significant rates of child labor occurred in the production of clay 
bricks, coal, emeralds, gold, coca, and pornography. Children also 
worked as street vendors and domestic servants and were engaged in 
begging and garbage scavenging. There were also reports that children 
were involved in agriculture, including coffee production and small 
family production centers in the unrefined brown sugar market, as well 
as selling inexpensive Venezuelan gasoline. Commercial sexual 
exploitation of children occurred (see section 6, Children).</p>
<p>Prohibitions against children working in mining and construction were
 reportedly largely ignored. Some educational institutions modify 
schedules during harvest seasons so that children may help on the family
 farm. Children worked in artisanal mining of coal, clay, emeralds, and 
gold under dangerous conditions and in many instances with the approval 
or insistence of their parents. The governmentâs efforts to assist 
children working in illegal mining focused on the departments of 
Antioquia and Boyaca.</p>
<p>There continued to be instances of child trafficking with the purpose
 of forced labor in mines, quarries, and private homes. According to 
government officials and international organizations, illegal drug 
traders and other illicit actors recruited children, sometimes forcibly,
 to work in their illegal activities. The ELN and organized criminal 
gangs forced children into sexual servitude or criminality to serve as 
combatants or coca pickers (see section 1.g.). Children working in the 
informal sector, including as street vendors, were also vulnerable to 
labor trafficking. The ICBF identified 651 children and adolescents who 
qualified for and received social services.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination with respect to employment or 
occupation based on race, sex, religion, political preference, national 
origin or citizenship, gender, disability, language, sexual orientation 
and/or gender identity, HIV-positive status or infection with other 
communicable diseases, or social status. Complaints of quid pro quo 
sexual harassment are filed not with the Ministry of Labor but with the 
criminal courts. The government did not effectively enforce the law in 
all cases.</p>
<p>Unemployment disproportionately affected women. They faced hiring 
discrimination and received salaries that generally were not 
commensurate with their education and experience. According to DANE, 
43.1 percent of working-age women were engaged in economic activity, 
compared with 56.9 percent of men. Sisma Mujer reported on average women
 were paid 28 percent less than men. In a previous year, a senior 
government official estimated that 85 percent of persons with 
disabilities were unemployed.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>The minimum monthly wage as decreed by the government was COP 
689,454 ($230) for all sectors. According to DANE, as of December 2016, 
28 percent of the national population lived in poverty: 24.9 percent of 
the urban population and 38.6 percent of the rural population lived 
below the poverty line. The share of the national population living in 
extreme poverty was 8.5 percent.</p>
<p>The law provides for a regular workweek of 48 hours and a minimum 
rest period of eight hours within the week. Exceptions to this may be 
granted by the Ministry of Labor and were frequently granted in the 
mining sector. The law provides for paid annual civil and religious 
holidays for all workers. Employees who work at least one full year are 
entitled to at least 15 days of paid vacation. The law stipulates that 
workers receive premium compensation for nighttime work, hours worked in
 excess of 48 per week, and work performed on Sundays. The law permits 
compulsory overtime only in exceptional cases where the work is 
considered essential for the companyâs functioning.</p>
<p>The law provides for workersâ occupational safety and health in the 
formal sector. The legal standards were generally up to date and 
appropriate for the countryâs main formal industries. The law does not 
cover informal-sector workers, including many mining and agricultural 
workers. In general the law protects workersâ rights to remove 
themselves from situations that endanger health or safety without 
jeopardy to their employment, although some violations of this right 
were reported during the year. In cases of formal grievances, 
authorities generally protected employees in this situation.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor is required to enforce labor laws in the formal
 sector, including occupational safety and health regulations, through 
periodic inspections by labor inspectors. The government reported that 
as of June 30, the ministry employed 859 inspectors countrywide, 
although not all conducted worksite inspections and most had little 
training in occupational safety and health issues. Individual labor 
violations can bring fines of up to 5,000 times the minimum monthly 
wage, but infractions for occupational safety and health can trigger 
fines of only up to 1,000 times the minimum monthly wage. Unionists 
stated that more fines needed to be collected to impact occupational 
safety and health issues.</p>
<p>While the governmentâs labor inspectors undertook administrative 
actions to enforce the minimum wage in the formal sector, the government
 did not conduct any action to do so in the informal sector.</p>
<p>To encourage the formalization of labor, the Ministry of Labor 
continued to promote formal employment generation. As of the first 
quarter of the year, the proportion of informal workers was 47.3 percent
 in cities and metropolitan cities, according to DANE. Formalization 
agreements in firms with illegal subcontracting increased during the 
year; however, some labor rights groups expressed concern that the 
formalization agreements were not sufficiently monitored by the Ministry
 of Labor. The government continued to support complementary social 
security programs to increase the employability of extremely poor 
individuals, displaced persons, and the elderly.</p>
<p>Nonunion workers, particularly those in the agricultural and port 
sectors, reportedly worked under hazardous conditions because they 
feared losing their jobs through subcontracting mechanisms or informal 
arrangements if they criticized abuses. Some unionized workers who 
alleged they suffered on-the-job injuries complained that companies 
illegally fired them in retaliation for filing workers compensation 
claims. Only the courts may order reinstatement, and workers complained 
the courts were backlogged, slow, and corrupt. The Ministry of Labor may
 sanction a company found to have broken the law in this way, but it may
 offer no other guarantees to workers.</p>
<p>Security forces reported that illegal armed actors, including FARC 
dissidents, the ELN, and organized criminal groups, engaged in illegal 
mining of gold, coal, coltan, nickel, copper, and other minerals. 
Illegal mines were particularly common in the departments of Antioquia, 
Bolivar, Cauca, Cordoba, Choco, Narino, and Tolima.</p>
<p>According to the National Mining Agency, through July 31, there were 
43 mine accidents reported, causing 51 minersâ deaths. The majority of 
both accidents and deaths were due to cave-ins. There were no reports of
 nonmining major industrial accidents through October.</p>
