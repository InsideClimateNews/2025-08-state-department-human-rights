				<h2 id="report-toc__exec-summary" class="report__section-title">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>

				<p>Romania is a constitutional republic with a democratic, 
multiparty parliamentary system. The bicameral parliament consists of 
the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, both elected by popular vote. In
 2014 the country held presidential elections in which electoral 
observers noted irregularities, including insufficient polling stations 
for the large diaspora community. In contrast, the country held 
parliamentary elections in December 2016, which observers generally 
considered to be free and fair and without irregularities.</p>
<p>Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the security forces.</p>
<p>Major human rights problems included police and gendarme mistreatment
 and harassment of detainees and Roma. Government efforts to address 
systemic corruption continued, but it remained a widespread problem. 
Systematic societal discrimination against Roma affected their access to
 adequate education, housing, health care, and employment.</p>
<p>Other human rights problems included poor prison conditions and 
overcrowding. The judiciary lacked sufficient personnel, physical space,
 and technology to function efficiently. The government failed to take 
effective action to return Greek Catholic and other churches confiscated
 by the communist-era government. There were continued reports of 
violence and discrimination against women. There were some anti-Semitic 
acts and statements, and Holocaust denial continued to be a problem. 
Anti-Semitic, racist, xenophobic, and nationalistic views continued to 
be disseminated via the internet. Government agencies provided 
inadequate assistance to persons with disabilities and did not respect 
standards of care for persons with disabilities in institutions, 
exposing them to abuse. Societal discrimination against lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons, particularly 
children, remained at high levels. Persons with HIV/AIDS continued to be
 subject to discrimination and harassment. Employers subjected men, 
women, and children to labor trafficking, particularly in agriculture, 
construction, domestic service, hotels, and manufacturing. Child labor 
was also a problem, and inadequate protection of children against abuse 
remained a general problem.</p>
<p>The judiciary took steps to prosecute and punish officials who 
committed abuses. Authorities repeatedly delayed lawsuits involving 
alleged police abuse, which in many cases resulted in acquittals.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings.</p>
<p>As of September 20, the trial of police officer George Stefan 
Isopescu was pending before the Bucharest Court of Appeals after the 
Bucharest Tribunal sentenced him to seven yearsâ imprisonment for 
aggravated battery leading to death. In 2014 Isopescu, who was working 
at Bucharest Precinct 10, allegedly beat to death a 26-year-old Romani 
man, Daniel Gabriel Dumitrache, who worked as a âparking boy,â earning 
income by finding parking spaces for drivers in exchange for tips.</p>
<p>In 2012 the Institute for Investigating Communist Crimes and the 
Memory of the Romanian Exile received authority to initiate criminal 
investigations of communist-era crimes discovered through its research. 
On February 10, in a final ruling, the High Court upheld a 20-year 
prison sentence for crimes against humanity given in 2015 to former 
communist-era prison official Alexandru Visinescu, whose trial began in 
August 2014 at the request of the institute. On March 30, the Bucharest 
Court of Appeals sentenced another such official, Ion Ficior, who ran a 
communist forced labor camp, also to 20 years in prison for inhuman 
treatment. The sentence was appealed before the High Court and remained 
pending as of mid-October.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Disappearance</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law prohibit such practices, but there were
 reports from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and media that police
 and gendarmes mistreated and abused prisoners, pretrial detainees, 
Roma, and other vulnerable persons, including homeless persons, women, 
sex workers, and substance users, primarily with excessive force, 
including beatings. Media reported various instances of such abuse 
throughout the year. In most cases, the police officers involved were 
exonerated.</p>
<p>The NGO Romani Center for Social Intervention and Studies (CRISS) 
stated that, in 43 cases of police brutality against Roma it documented 
over the previous 10 years, there were no convictions at the national 
level, in part because of prosecutorial decisions not to send the cases 
to court. Racism was not investigated as a motive in any of the cases. 
The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in a number of cases 
after finding the justice system had failed to deliver a just outcome, 
including cases of police brutality, particularly against Roma, and 
cases involving abuses in psychiatric hospitals. At the national level, 
the average time for resolving a case involving police abuse of Roma was
 3.76 years, with another five years on average before the ECHR.</p>
<p>On June 6, media showed images of police in the middle of Bucharest 
beating and taunting a naked man, whose hands and feet were in 
restraints. The victim was later committed to a psychiatric hospital. 
Police announced they would conduct an investigation, which was still 
pending at yearâs end.</p>
<p>In May 2015 the Association for the Defense of Human Rights-Helsinki 
Committee (APADOR-CH) published a report on the situation in Racos, 
Brasov County, where a Romani community of more than 1,200 persons was 
located. Community members complained that police had terrorized and 
repeatedly beaten them over the previous three years and that the Brasov
 prosecutorâs office had handled their complaints improperly, closing 
all cases. In addition, four men, two wearing overalls and the other two
 balaclavas, reportedly beat a civil activist who was advising members 
of the community on how to file complaints. As of September, the case 
was still pending before the Brasov Tribunal, with the head of the local
 police among the defendants.</p>
<h4>Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h4>
<p>Prison conditions remained harsh and did not meet international 
standards. The abuse of prisoners by authorities and other prisoners 
reportedly continued to be a problem. According to media, NGO and 
ombudsperson reports, guards assaulted prisoners and at times prisoners 
assaulted and abused fellow inmates. In March the government adopted new
 regulations for prisons and pretrial arrest, detention, and 
confinement, bringing prison regulations in line with criminal 
legislation in force since 2014.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: According to official figures, 
overcrowding was a problem, particularly in a number of prisons that did
 not meet the standard of 43 square feet per prisoner set by the Council
 of Europeâs Committee for the Prevention of Torture. As of July, the 
country held 28,278 persons in prisons that had space for only 18, 826. 
While observers noted some improvements in certain areasâmainly in 
existing spaces or as a consequence of greater spending on repair and 
retrofittingâconditions remained generally poor within the prison 
system.</p>
<p>In July protests broke out and spread to about one-half of the 
countryâs prisons for several days due to poor living conditions. 
Protesters went on hunger strikes, burnt mattresses, and threw bottles 
at guards. Four inmates from Giurgiu maximum-security penitentiary filed
 a complaint with the penitentiary administration, claiming they had 
been severely beaten by unidentified assailants wearing balaclavas, at 
the instruction of guards, retaliating after the protests. An 
investigation by the National Penitentiary Administration (NPA) was 
pending. A team from the ombudspersonâs office also made visits to 
penitentiaries in Iasi and Botosani during the protests and found that 
specially trained prison guards used beatings during their interventions
 to stop the protests. Guards also used tear gas in Iasi. Authorities 
transferred 53 prisoners from Iasi and 46 from Botosani, whom they 
considered to be instigators, to other penitentiaries. Inmates in Iasi 
told the ombudspersonâs team they were afraid to talk for fear of 
reprisals. As of September, five complaints against penitentiary staff 
had been lodged with the NPA for actions falling under the category of 
crimes against life, torture, or other cruel and inhuman treatment. The 
NPA sent the complaints to prosecutors, who dismissed one case; the 
other four remained pending. Also, inmates filed another 15 complaints 
with NPA for abusive behavior by staff. Of these, prosecutors dismissed 
nine and six were in the process of being resolved. Inmates can also 
file complaints directly with prosecutors. Statistics were not 
available.</p>
<p>According to reports by the NPA, in the first eight months of the 
year, 58 persons died in prisons, three from suicide and 55 from various
 illnesses.</p>
<p>In September and October, penitentiary staff began protests over poor
 working conditions related to too many overtime hours without pay and 
not being able to take annual leave due to a chronic staffing shortage. 
They also asked for equity in salary with other professionals in the 
defense and public-order sectors, in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>In April the government adopted an investment plan through 2023 to 
improve living conditions and create additional space in prisons. The 
plan was adopted to avoid a potential ECHR decision that could halt all 
cases related to prison conditions until the systemic situation is 
remedied. In October Justice Minister Raluca Pruna stated she had lied 
to the ECHR when she reported that the government had money for 
penitentiaries, noting that the documentation she had been provided was 
not based on actual budgetary allocations. Following these statements, 
the Chamber of Deputies called for Pruna to step down via a nonbinding 
vote. Pruna countered that only the prime minister could ask for her 
resignation, which did not happen. As of August, 371 new spaces for 
prisoners had been created.</p>
<p>A number of prisons provided insufficient medical care, and food 
quality was poor and sometimes insufficient in quantity. The standard 
food allotment was less than 17 lei (four dollars) per day per inmate. 
In some prisons, heating and ventilation were inadequate. While noting 
improvements at some prisons, APADOR-CH reported that most were 
overcrowded and that a number of them had inadequate conditions, 
including insufficient medical care, poor food quality, mold in kitchens
 and cells, understaffing, an insufficient number of bathrooms, poor 
hygiene, insects, an insufficient number of doctors (including no 
psychologists in some prisons), lack of work opportunities, and 
insufficient educational activities.</p>
<p>APADOR-CH stated that most police pretrial detention facilities had 
inadequate conditions, particularly in terms of hygiene and 
overcrowding. Such facilities were often located in basements and had no
 natural light and inadequate sanitary and water accommodations. In some
 pretrial facilities and prisons, there was no possibility for 
confidential meetings between detainees and their families or attorneys.
 APADOR-CH also criticized the lack of adequate treatment with 
substitute substances for former drug addicts, and the lack of HIV and 
hepatitis prevention measures.</p>
<p>As of mid-July 2016, the ECHR ruled in 11 cases against Romania and 
ordered 287,700 euros ($316,000) to be paid to victims. Also, in 20 
cases, settlements were reached that paid a total of 720,570 euros 
($793,000) to victims and, in one case, there was a unilateral 
declaration acknowledging the violation with 12,600 euros ($13,900) to 
be paid to victims.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: Independent authorities did not always investigate credible allegations of inhuman conditions.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: The government permitted monitoring 
visits by independent human rights observers, and such visits occurred 
during the year. The ombudsperson also visited prisons as part of his 
new mandate to monitor places where persons are confined.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government generally respected these prohibitions.</p>
<h4>ROLE OF THE POLICE AND SECURITY APPARATUS</h4>
<p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs is responsible for the General 
Inspectorate of the Romanian Police; the gendarmerie; the border police;
 the Department of Intelligence and Internal Protection (DIPI), which 
oversees the collection of intelligence on organized crime and 
corruption; and the Directorate General for Anticorruption. The prime 
minister appoints the head of DIPI. The General Inspectorate of the 
Romanian Police is divided into functional directorates, and there are 
42 regional directorates, one for each county and the city of Bucharest.
 Internal disciplinary councils at the work locations of accused police 
officers handle complaints of misconduct.</p>
<p>The Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI), the countryâs domestic 
security agency, investigates terrorism and national security issues. 
The president nominates and parliament confirms the SRI director. SRI 
submits annual activity reports to parliament, which has a standing 
committee for SRI oversight. Some observers, however, regarded this 
committee as lacking independence and as ineffective in conducting 
meaningful oversight of SRI.</p>
<p>Impunity was a problem. Police were frequently exonerated of 
allegations of beatings and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 (see section 1.c.). Police corruption contributed to citizensâ lack of 
respect for police and a corresponding disregard for their authority. 
Low salaries and the absence of incentives and bonuses led to personal 
financial difficulties and contributed to making individual law 
enforcement officials susceptible to bribery. Authorities referred 
instances of high-level corruption to the Directorate General for 
Anticorruption within the Ministry of Internal Affairs.</p>
<p>In September a court ordered police to provide, free of charge, their
 stop-and-search procedures to an NGO that had requested them. The 
procedures were used to identify persons, take fingerprints and 
photographs, perform body and bag searches, and âadministratively takeâ 
persons to a police station. APADOR-CH had previously requested the 
procedures, but police claimed the information was classified. The NGO 
sued under the freedom of information act. In court, police argued they 
did not provide the procedures in order to prevent criminals from 
gaining knowledge of police methods. APADOR-CH later found the 
procedures in a book prefaced by former interior minister Petre Toba, 
meaning they were available via other, open-source means. The Bucharest 
court ruled that police had to give the procedures to the NGO, as a 
matter of access to public information. As of October, police had not 
provided the information, and the NGO was preparing to file another suit
 to force execution.</p>
<h4>ARREST PROCEDURES AND TREATMENT OF DETAINEES</h4>
<p>The law provides that only judges may issue detention and search 
warrants, and the government generally respected this provision. The law
 requires authorities to inform detainees at the time of their arrest of
 the charges against them and their legal rights, including the right to
 remain silent and the right to an attorney. Police must notify 
detainees of their rights in a language they understand before obtaining
 a statement. Authorities must bring detainees before a court within 24 
hours of arrest. Although authorities generally respected these 
requirements, there were some reports of abuses during the year. Pending
 trial, if the alleged offender does not pose any danger to conducting 
the trial, there is no concern of flight or commission of another crime,
 and if the case does not present a âreasonable suspicionâ that the 
person would have committed the offense, the investigation is conducted 
with the alleged offender at liberty. Depending on the circumstances of 
the case, aside from pretrial detention, the law provides for home 
detention and for pretrial investigation under judicial supervision, 
meaning, among other provisions, that the person must report regularly 
to law enforcement. A bail system also exists, but it was seldom used. 
Detainees have the right to counsel and, in most cases, had prompt 
access to a lawyer of their choice. Authorities provided indigent 
detainees legal counsel at public expense. The arresting officer is also
 responsible for contacting the detaineeâs lawyer or, alternatively, the
 local bar association to arrange for a lawyer. The detainee has the 
right to meet privately with counsel before the first police interview. A
 lawyer may be present during the interview or interrogation. Detainees 
also had prompt access to their families.</p>
<p>The law allows police to take an individual to a police station 
without a warrant for endangering the public or other individuals or 
disrupting public order. There were allegations that police often used 
this provision to hold persons for up to 24 hours. Since those held in 
such cases were not formally detained or arrested, authorities 
determined their right to counsel did not apply. APADOR-CH criticized 
this provision as leaving room for abuse.</p>
<p><u>Pretrial Detention</u>: A judge may order pretrial detention for 
periods up to 30 days, depending on the status of the case. While a 
court may extend this period in 30-day increments, total pretrial 
detention may not exceed 180 days. Under the law, detainees may hold 
courts and prosecutors liable for unjustifiable, illegal, or abusive 
measures. According to human rights NGOs, in many cases authorities 
automatically extended pretrial detention, even if the reasons for the 
original arrest no longer existed. APADOR-CH conducted research into how
 preventive arrest is determined and found it was the most common 
pretrial preventive measure ordered. Most decisions in such cases were 
upheld upon judicial review, and courts rarely considered more lenient 
measures.</p>
<p><u>Detaineeâs Ability to Challenge Lawfulness of Detention before a Court</u>:
 Any measure taken against an alleged offender pending trial, including 
pretrial detention, home arrest, or judicial supervision, may be 
contested before a court different from the one that ordered it, within 
48 hours. The new court must rule on the contestation within five days 
of registration. The contestation is lodged with the court that ordered 
the measure, which must forward it, together with the case file, to the 
next-level court, also within 48 hours. Contesting such a measure does 
not suspend its execution. The prosecutor must be present when the court
 rules on the contestation, and the alleged offender must be assisted by
 a lawyer, either of the offenderâs choice or provided by the state.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for an independent judiciary. The 
government generally respected judicial independence but failed to 
provide sufficient personnel, physical space, and technology to enable 
the judiciary to act swiftly and efficiently, thereby resulting in 
excessively long trials.</p>
<p>The Superior Council of Magistrates (CSM) is the countryâs judicial 
governance body. It generally maintained transparency of operations and 
acted promptly to suspend judges and prosecutors suspected of legal 
violations. The number of high-level corruption trials remained steady 
during the year.</p>
<h4>TRIAL PROCEDURES</h4>
<p>The constitution and the law provide for the right to a fair public 
trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right.</p>
<p>Under the law, defendants enjoy the right to the presumption of 
innocence, have the right to be informed promptly and in detail of the 
charges against them, and have the right to free linguistic 
interpretation if necessary from the moment charged through all appeals.
 Trials are open to the public and should take place without undue 
delay, but in many cases delays occurred because of the heavy caseload 
or procedural inconsistencies. Defendants have the right to be present 
at trial. The law provides for the right to counsel and the right to 
consult an attorney in a timely manner. The law requires that the 
government provide an attorney to juveniles in criminal cases; the 
Ministry of Justice paid local bar associations to provide attorneys to 
indigent clients. Defendants may confront or question witnesses against 
them (unless the witness is an undercover agent), present witnesses and 
evidence on their own behalf, and have a court-appointed interpreter. 
The law generally provides for the right of defendants and their 
attorneys to view and consult case files. The prosecution may restrict 
access to evidence for reasons such as victimâs rights and national 
security. Both prosecutors and defendants have a right of appeal. 
Defendants may not be compelled to testify against themselves and have 
the legal right to abstain from making statements with no negative legal
 consequence. Prosecutors may use any statements by defendants against 
them in court.</p>
<p>The law allows for home detention using electronic monitoring 
devices, but the government did not procure such devices. A judge may 
detain a person for up to five years during a trial, which is deducted 
from the prison sentence if the person is convicted. Arrests generally 
took place during the investigative phase rather than during the trial 
phase. The law separates the roles of various types of judges, including
 the preliminary judge, who examines evidence and pretrial motions; the 
judge for rights and liberties, who seeks to ensure the defendantâs 
constitutional rights are not violated; and the trial judge, who is 
legally required to be separate from the judge for rights and liberties.
 Some courts, however, lacked a sufficient number of judges to separate 
these functions.</p>
<p>Prosecutors may introduce evidence, including evidence acquired from 
wiretaps, during their investigations and in their indictments. Media 
often reported this information, especially in high-level corruption 
cases. Some judges and human rights advocates complained that excessive 
media coverage of arrests and the use of pretrial detention resulted in 
unfair justice. Some prosecutors and judges complained to the CSM that 
media outlets and politiciansâ statement damaged their professional 
reputations. The CSM determined some politiciansâ public statements 
infringed on judicial independence.</p>
<p>In June the informant in one of three corruption cases against the 
former head of the Organized Crime Directorate, Alina Bica, testified 
before the High Court of Cassation and Justice that, while he was under 
arrest, he made a deal with National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) 
prosecutors to testify against Bica, in exchange for leniency in his 
case. He later recanted his accusation. The case remained pending.</p>
<p>The DNA indicted Craiova mayor Lia Olguta Vasilescu for allegedly 
using her influence before becoming mayor in 2012 to illegally pressure 
local business leaders to sponsor her political campaign. As mayor, she 
also allegedly pressured companies that had contracts with the mayorâs 
office to sponsor an NGO to rehabilitate a number of buildings in 
Craiova. During the year Vasilescu was charged with bribery, using her 
authority or influence to obtain money or other undue benefits, and 
money laundering. The mayor was initially detained for 24 hours in March
 when the investigations against her started, but the courts did not 
sanction keeping her under preventive arrest. She was placed under house
 arrest for a week, and courts then ruled against house arrest as well. 
Courts also rejected subsequent requests by the DNA for judicial 
supervision, and she was investigated and then went to trial while 
remaining free. She was re-elected mayor of Craiova in June. In December
 the court rejected some of the evidence against her and remanded her 
case to the DNA for further review. The case remained pending.</p>
<p>In September several professional associations released a joint 
âMemorandum Concerning Justice,â which enumerated some of the issues the
 associations found troubling, including a request for âguaranteeing 
magistratesâ status and independence, including by appropriate 
compensation levels and ensuring decent working conditions.â</p>
<h4>POLITICAL PRISONERS AND DETAINEES</h4>
<p>There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees.</p>
<h4>CIVIL JUDICIAL PROCEDURES AND REMEDIES</h4>
<p>Civil courts are independent and function in every jurisdiction. 
Judicial and administrative remedies are available to individuals and 
organizations for violations of human rights by government agencies. 
Plaintiffs may appeal adverse judgments involving alleged violations of 
human rights by the state to the ECHR after exhausting the avenues of 
appeal in the domestic courts.</p>
<p>Approximately 80 percent of court cases in the country were civil 
cases. Caseloads were divided unevenly, which resulted in vastly 
different efficiency rates across the country. A lack of both 
jurisprudence and a modern case management system contributed to a high 
number of appeals as well as lengthy trials. Litigants sometimes 
encountered difficulties enforcing civil verdicts because the procedures
 for enforcing court orders were impractical and caused delays.</p>
<h4>PROPERTY RESTITUTION</h4>
<p>The law for restituting property seized by the former communist and 
fascist regimes includes a âpointsâ system (one point for each Romanian 
leu of property value) to compensate claimants for whom restitution of 
the original property is not possible. The claimants may use the points 
to bid in auctions of state-owned property or exchange them for monetary
 compensation. Parliament intended the law to speed up restitution and 
aimed for in-kind restitution whenever practicable, but local 
authorities hindered land restitution by failing to complete a land 
inventory by the deadline stipulated in the law, and the central 
government facilitated delays by twice extending the deadline for the 
inventoryâs completion.</p>
<p>There were numerous disputes over church buildings and property that 
the Orthodox Church failed to return to the Greek Catholic Church, 
despite court orders to do so. The government also did not take 
effective action to return churches confiscated by the post-World War II
 communist government. In January 2015, following a 2014 ruling by the 
Ploesti Court of Appeals, the local council of Sfantu Gheorghe took over
 the Miko School, which the former communist government had expropriated
 from the Hungarian Reformed Church. Viewing the move as 
renationalization, the Reformed Church filed a complaint with the ECHR. 
It also asked the National Authority for the Restitution of Property for
 the schoolâs return, but the request was denied in May. Amendments to 
address properties forcibly âdonatedâ during these eras and to grant 
priority status to Holocaust survivors were adopted in May. Associations
 of former owners asserted that the points compensation system was 
ineffective and continued to criticize the restitution law for failing 
to resolve the problem in a fair manner and generating lengthy delays 
and corruption. The pace of resolving restitution cases at the 
administrative level increased. In the case of churches and national 
minorities, however, the number of properties returned was 
disproportionately low. Through September, out of 1,278 resolved church 
cases, 13 properties were returned, compensation was granted in 12 
cases, 21 cases were withdrawn, and the remaining 1,232 cases ended with
 negative decisions. Regarding national minorities, of the 79 cases 
resolved through September, none resulted in restitution. Many of these 
decisions have been appealed. As of September 30, there were 7,885 
pending requests for restitution from denominations.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Arbitrary or Unlawful Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence</h3>

					
					<p>Although the constitution and law prohibit such actions, there 
were accusations by NGOs, politicians, and journalists that authorities 
illegally engaged in electronic eavesdropping. In 2014 an SRI report 
stated that it completed 44,000 legal wiretaps, or nearly 122 per day, 
that year. In February the Constitutional Court found part of a 
provision enabling the intelligence services to conduct technical 
surveillance in criminal investigations unconstitutional. The court 
found the provisionâs lack of clarity, precision, and predictability 
could result in infringements on the fundamental rights and freedoms of 
citizens. In March the government passed an emergency ordinance 
restricting the conduct of technical surveillance by the SRI to cases 
involving national security and terrorism.</p>
<p>The law permits the use of electronic eavesdropping in cases 
involving organized crime, national security, and other serious 
offenses. By law the investigating prosecutor must first obtain a 
warrant from a judge. In exceptional circumstances, when delays in 
getting the warrant would seriously affect a criminal investigation, 
prosecutors may begin surveillance for 48 hours without a judicial 
warrant but must then submit a request within 24 hours for retroactive 
authorization. When there is a threat to national security, the law 
permits the prosecutor general to request authorization from the 
president of the High Court of Cassation and Justice for issuance of a 
warrant for an initial period of six months and to request extensions 
for up to two years in three-month increments. Some human rights NGOs 
noted the contradiction between the two laws with regard to the 
requirement for judicial approval of wiretaps.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Speech and Press</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and 
the government generally respected these rights. An independent press, 
largely independent judiciary, and functioning democratic political 
system combined to promote freedom of speech and press. Independent 
organizations such as Reporters without Borders noted excessive 
politicization of the media, corrupt financing mechanisms, editorial 
policies subordinated to owner interests, and influence by intelligence 
services.</p>
<p><u>Freedom of Speech and Expression</u>: The law prohibits denying 
the Holocaust and promoting or using the symbols of fascist, racist, 
xenophobic, or Legionnaire ideologies, the latter being the nationalist,
 extremist, anti-Semitic interwar movement that was the main perpetrator
 of the Holocaust in the country.</p>
<p><u>Press and Media Freedoms</u>: While independent media were active 
and expressed a wide variety of views without overt restriction, 
politicians and persons with close ties to politicians and political 
groups either owned or indirectly controlled numerous media outlets at 
the national and local levels. The news and editorial tone of these 
outlets frequently reflected the views of the owners. There were also 
allegations that owners suppressed stories at odds with their interests 
or threatened the authors of such stories.</p>
<p>There were attempts to restrict the editorial independence of the 
print media. In April a Caras Severin County court imposed total civil 
damages of 15,000 lei ($3,700) against reporters Oana Bejenariu and 
Alexandra Jurca of&nbsp;<i>Epress de Banat</i>&nbsp;jointly for writing a
 report critical of the professional performance of the head of the 
local public-labor agency, ruling the report damaged the officialâs 
public image. Reporters of 10 local and national media outlets protested
 the decision. The journalists appealed, but a higher court rejected the
 appeal in September.</p>
<p>There were also reports of restrictions on the independence of 
broadcast media. On March 15, three reporters from public radio station 
Radio Romania accused station management of running a biased campaign, 
allowing only views that opposed a draft amendment to the public 
broadcastersâ law concerning the leadership position in public media. 
The National Audio-Visual Council found the managementâs alleged 
campaign in breach of media law, for its lack of balance in debates on 
the topic. Following the reportersâ disclosures, Radio Romania 
leadership asked for a disciplinary commission against two of the 
journalists, but the commission concluded that there was no disciplinary
 breach and dismissed the case. Media NGOs warned that the number of 
Radio Romania journalists harassed through these types of disciplinary 
investigations was increasing.</p>
<p>Radio Romania also faced accusations of censorship. In November, 
Radio Romania Actualitatiâits primary news channelâcut the live 
transmission of a debate between civil society, media, and the president
 on the topic of public media services when the debate turned to issues 
of concern to the public radio broadcaster. A media NGO asked the 
National Audio-Visual Council to verify whether Radio Romania 
Actualitati infringed on audio-visual regulations by intentionally 
cutting the live radio transmission and later censuring radio reports on
 the debate. The council had not addressed the request as of late 
December.</p>
<p><u>Violence and Harassment</u>: Politicians and citizens sometimes insulted or harassed journalists.</p>
<p>Freelance reporter Emilia Sercan, who was also a lecturer at the 
University of Bucharest School of Journalism, received multiple threats 
for stories exposing plagiarism in doctoral papers by top officials, 
including former prime minister Victor Ponta, former interior minister 
Petre Toba, former interior and defense minister Gabriel Oprea, and 
others. Sercan reported receiving threats from unknown individuals over 
the telephone and on her Facebook page.</p>
<p>On June 4, reporter Robert Iosub published a telephone conversation 
with deputy Liviu Harbuz, who repeatedly insulted and cursed him after 
he called for a comment. Iosub also claimed he has been threatened and 
monitored illegally by unknown individuals. Harbuz publicly admitted to 
the conversation and claimed the reporter was supporting one of his 
political opponents.</p>
<p><u>Libel/Slander Laws</u>: Under the law, libel, slander, and insult are civil, not criminal, matters.</p>
<p><u>National Security</u>: On August 18, four local media NGOs 
protested authoritiesâ opening a criminal investigation against a team 
of British journalists from Sky News who were accused of communicating 
false information that could affect national security. Sky News had 
reported on alleged weapons smuggling through the country from Ukraine 
to Western countries or the Middle East. The NGOs claimed that a media 
report could not affect national security and that the governmentâs 
argument implied authorities could place under criminal investigation 
anyone who criticizes the government on national security matters. The 
government maintained that the story, which was proven false, was 
intended to provoke a law enforcement reaction, which diverted 
intelligence and counterterrorism resources and damaged relations with 
other countries. The case continued. On October 10, the Supreme Court 
ordered that the three persons interviewed by Sky News be released from 
pretrial arrest. Prosecutors had appealed to the Supreme Court after a 
lower court of appeal had also ordered their release.</p>
<h4>INTERNET FREEDOM</h4>
<p>The government did not restrict or disrupt access to the internet or 
censor online content, and there were no credible reports that the 
government monitored private online communications without appropriate 
legal authority. According to the latest European Commission report, 52 
percent of the population regularly used the internet.</p>
<h4>ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND CULTURAL EVENTS</h4>
<p>There were no government restrictions on cultural events.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association</h3>

					
					<h4>FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY</h4>
<p>The constitution provides for freedom of assembly, and the government
 generally respected this right. The law provides that unarmed citizens 
may assemble peacefully but also stipulates that meetings must not 
interfere with other economic or social activities and may not take 
place near such locations as hospitals, airports, or military 
installations. Organizers of public assemblies must request permits in 
writing three days in advance from the mayorâs office of the locality 
where the gathering is to occur. There were reports that some protesters
 had difficulty obtaining permits.</p>
<p>In June, 10 human rights NGOs wrote an open letter to the minister of
 the interior, claiming the gendarmerie had abused protesters at events 
with the aim of discouraging free speech. The letter referred mainly to 
an event commemorating the October 2015 Colectiv nightclub fire, which 
killed more than 60 persons and led to the resignation of the prime 
minister. A few days after the event, the organizer was fined for 
organizing an undeclared and unregistered public gathering.</p>
<p>The LGBTI rights group Accept Association claimed the procedures for 
organizing a pride parade during the year were overly burdensome, with 
some authorizations coming through only shortly before the event, 
although initial requests had been made months before.</p>
<h4>FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION</h4>
<p>The constitution provides for freedom of association, and the 
government generally respected this right. The law prohibits fascist, 
communist, racist, or xenophobic ideologies, organizations, and symbols.</p>
<p>In February the Mures Court of Appeals rejected the registration 
request of an association seeking to promote the historically 
ethnic-Hungarian region of Szeklerland as a tourist destination and 
bearing a name that included âSzeklerland.â The court upheld the 
decision of the lower-level Mures Tribunal on the grounds that 
Szeklerland was being defined along ethnic lines, which, according to 
the courts, is not permitted in the country. The court acknowledged that
 other historic regions of the country could be promoted as tourist 
destinations because they were not defined along ethnic lines and their 
existence as tourist areas could be recognized for other reasons.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Freedom of Movement, Internally Displaced Persons, Protection of Refugees, and Stateless Persons</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law provide for the freedom of internal 
movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the 
government generally respected these rights.</p>
<p>The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in providing 
protection and assistance to refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary 
protection (collectively referred to as âbeneficiaries of international 
protectionâ); asylum-seekers and applicants for subsidiary protection 
(collectively referred to as âapplicants of international protectionâ); 
stateless persons; and other persons of concern, which can include 
irregular migrants potentially in need of international protection.</p>
<p><u>In-country Movement</u>: The internal movement of beneficiaries of
 international protection and stateless persons was generally not 
restricted. Changes made to the law on asylum and its regulations in 
December 2015 and January provide that the General Inspectorate for 
Immigration may designate a specific place of residence for an applicant
 for international protection while authorities determine his or her 
eligibility or may take restrictive measures that amount to detention in
 âspecially arranged closed areas.â Applicants who do not qualify for 
international protection are treated as aliens who no longer have a 
right to stay in the country and may be taken into custody with the goal
 of removal. Applicants for or beneficiaries of international protection
 in certain circumstancesâparticularly those declared âundesirableâ for 
reasons of national securityâmay be subject to administrative detention 
in public custody centers. The two public custody centers in the country
 are in Arad and Bucharest.</p>
<p>While the internal movement of asylum seekers was generally not 
restricted, the government may grant âtolerated statusâ to asylum 
seekers who do not meet the requirements for refugee status or 
subsidiary protection, but who cannot be returned for various reasons, 
such as where the life of the rejected asylum seeker would be in danger 
or where she or he could be submitted to torture or inhuman and 
degrading treatment. Persons with âtolerated statusâ had the right to 
work but did not benefit from any other social protection or inclusion 
provisions and the government restricted their freedom of movement to a 
specific region of the country. According to official statistics from 
the General Inspectorate for Immigration, there were 308 individuals 
registered with âtolerated statusâ as of December 2015.</p>
<h4>PROTECTION OF REFUGEES</h4>
<p><u>Access to Asylum</u>: The law provides for access to asylum 
procedures to foreign nationals and stateless persons who express their 
desire for protection, which may be in the form of refugee status or 
temporary protection (âsubsidiary protectionâ status in the EU). The 
asylum law prohibits the expulsion, extradition, or forced return of any
 asylum seeker at the countryâs border or from within the countryâs 
territory, but this was not without exception, particularly in cases 
that fell under the countryâs terrorism laws.</p>
<p>Applications for international protection may also be filed with 
border police upon entering or exiting the country. In such situations, 
applications are channeled into a âborder procedure,â which is carried 
out by the designated asylum authority, the General Inspectorate for 
Immigrationâs Directorate for Asylum and Integration. Under border 
procedures, decisions are made within three days, and applicants may 
either be granted access to the country and to the ordinary procedure or
 have their claims rejected as manifestly unfounded. In theory it is 
also be possible to grant refugee status from the moment an application 
is filed, but no known cases of this have occurred.</p>
<p>UNHCR noted no significant impediments regarding access to asylum 
procedures or discrimination in access during the year with respect to 
specific populations. Nevertheless, there were several allegations of 
denial of access to the country and/or the asylum procedures at the 
border areas and transit zones. Several applicants for international 
protection, including Syrian nationals who arrived via the Black Sea in 
February 2015, were convicted of âillegal entryâ and prosecuted for 
smuggling in their family members while their applications for 
protection continued to be rejected during the year. A court granted one
 Syrian national from the group access to a new asylum procedure, but 
his case was rejected once again at the administrative level and 
remained pending in a local court as of late December.</p>
<p>Approval of an international protection application filed in the 
country may result in the granting of either refugee status or 
subsidiary protection. The latter is a form of complementary protection 
that, pursuant to EU directives, is granted at the EU level to an 
applicant who does not qualify as a refugee but has shown substantial 
grounds for needing protection.</p>
<p>Between January and July, 274 individuals were granted international 
protection at the administrative level (176 refugee status and 98 
subsidiary protection) and nine at the judicial level (three refugee 
status and six subsidiary protection).</p>
<p><u>Safe Country of Origin/Transit</u>: The law provides for the 
concept of safe countries of origin. This normally refers to EU member 
states but also includes a list of countries approved by the Interior 
Ministry at the recommendation of the General Inspectorate for 
Immigration, which must be published in accordance with the law. As of 
September, a ministerâs order to this effect had not been issued. 
Procedurally, the government would normally reject applications for 
asylum by persons who had arrived from a safe country under accelerated 
procedures as manifestly unfounded, except in cases where the factual 
situation or evidence presented by the applicant shows the existence of a
 well-founded fear of persecution. In the latter case, the adjudicating 
authority is required to grant the applicant access to the ordinary 
procedure. The law does not provide exceptions for the serious risk of 
harm that would warrant the grant of subsidiary protection. There were 
no known reports of rejections of applications for international 
protection based on application on safe country of origin. Three asylum 
applications by EU nationals were rejected at the administrative level 
of the asylum procedure between January and July; no information 
regarding the legal basis for the rejections was available.</p>
<p>The law also refers to the concept of a safe third country. The 
provisions in the law related to this concept are far reaching, as the 
law extends to irregular migrants who transited and were offered 
protection in a third country considered safe or who had the opportunity
 at the border or on the soil of a safe third country to contact 
authorities for the purpose of obtaining protection. In such cases, 
authorities may deny access to asylum procedures if the designated safe 
third country agrees to readmit the applicant to its territory and grant
 access to asylum procedures.</p>
<p><u>Refoulement</u>: The law establishes exceptions to the principle 
of nonrefoulement and the withdrawal of the right to stay following a 
declaration of a person as âundesirable.â This may occur, for example, 
when classified information or âwell-founded indicationsâ suggest that 
aliens (including stateless persons), applicants for international 
protection, or beneficiaries of international protection, intend to 
commit terrorist acts or favor terrorism. Applicants for protection who 
are declared âundesirableâ on national security grounds were taken into 
custody pending the finalization of their asylum procedure and then 
deported.</p>
<p><u>Freedom of movement</u>: While the internal movement of applicants
 for international protection was generally not restricted, legislation 
adopted in 2015 provides for placing asylum seekers under detention. 
Authorities may detain regular asylum seekers in custody centers or in 
âclosed spaces arranged for this purposeâ for a maximum of 60 days. 
Authorities may detain asylum seekers who present a danger to national 
security but may also use detention to limit abuses of the asylum 
procedure. NGOs and UNHCR expressed concern that the vague wording 
âabuse of the asylum procedureâ could lead to abusive placement of 
migrants in detention.</p>
<p>The law incorporates four ârestrictiveâ measures under which the 
internal movement of applicants for international protection may be 
limited. The first two establish an obligation to report regularly to 
the General Inspectorate for Immigration and to reside at a regional 
reception center (similar to placement under judicial control under the 
criminal code). These were deemed alternatives to detention.</p>
<p>A third restrictive measure allows authorities to place applicants in
 âspecially arranged closed areasâ for a maximum of 60 days, either to 
conduct the asylum procedure (especially if there is a risk of 
absconding) or if the asylum seeker is deemed to pose a danger to 
national security. There was one case of placement in a specially 
arranged closed area since the measure came into force on April 20.</p>
<p>Authorities may also place applicants for international protection in
 administrative detention in a public custody center if they are subject
 to a transfer decision to another EU member state under the Dublin 
Regulations III or if they have been declared âundesirableâ for reasons 
of national security, pending their removal from the country. Public 
custody centers are normally used to detain apprehended irregular 
migrants.</p>
<p>During the year amendments to the asylum law to limit âabuse to the 
asylum procedureâ took effect. Under these amendments, irregular 
migrants who submit their first application for international protection
 while in public custody are no longer automatically released but are 
only released if granted access to the ordinary procedure. The 
amendments raised concerns among UN agencies and civil society due to 
the ambiguity in the phrases âabuse of the asylum procedureâ and ârisk 
of absconding.â</p>
<p>The period of detention in a public custody center can periodically be prolonged, up to a maximum of 18 months.</p>
<p><u>Employment</u>: Asylum seekers have the right to work starting 
three months after they submit their first asylum application, if the 
process has not been completed. This period begins again if the 
applicant obtains access to a new asylum procedure. Even when granted 
the right to work, many asylum seekers faced problems finding legal 
work, mainly due to the limited validity of their identification 
documents and lack of awareness among potential employers of their right
 to work.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries of international protection do not face any legal 
obstacles in accessing employment, as they have the right to work under 
the same conditions as citizens and do not require additional work 
permits or other documents. While persons granted protection have the 
legal right to work, job scarcity, low wages, lack of language 
proficiency, and lack of recognized academic degrees and other 
certifications often resulted in unemployment or employment without a 
legal contract and its related benefits and protections.</p>
<p><u>Access to Basic Services</u>: By law persons granted refugee or 
subsidiary protection status have the same rights as citizens to access 
education, housing, lifelong learning and employment, public health 
care, and social security. Nevertheless, effective access to these 
rights varied across the country, depending on the level of awareness of
 various public and private actors responsible for ensuring access to 
these services.</p>
<p>State financial assistance to asylum seekers increased during the 
year from approximately 3.6 lei (one dollar) per day to 16 lei (four 
dollars) per day, with slightly increased allowances for vulnerable 
persons, which was low by the countryâs living standards. Persons with 
special needs or vulnerabilities were particularly affected. Although 
supplementary financial support was provided under EU-sponsored 
projects, annual gaps between these projects regularly led to limits in 
funding availability. New provisions granting applicants of 
international protection explicit access to social assistance have yet 
to yield results, due primarily to a lack of awareness and/or incorrect 
interpretation of different laws at the local level. Applicants for 
international protection had limited options for meaningful activities, 
such as language classes, cultural orientation, and skills training, 
while Romanian language classes were no longer available. State-provided
 social, psychological, and medical assistance for applicants for 
international protection remained insufficient, with many dependent on 
NGO-implemented projects for such help. Assistance for victims of trauma
 and torture was lacking.</p>
<p><u>Durable Solutions</u>: According to the Justice and Home Affairs 
Council decisions in September 2015, the country was allocated a quota 
of 6,205 applicants for international protection for relocation from 
other EU member states facing pressure on their national asylum systems,
 most notably Greece and Italy. Relocations commenced in March; 
applicants for international relocation were channeled into the ordinary
 asylum procedure. As of December 31, authorities had relocated 554 
asylum seekers to the country from Italy and Greece after vetting them 
for national security risk. Authorities granted international protection
 to nearly 100 percent of relocated asylum seekers. Relocated asylum 
seekers have rights identical to those of other asylum seekers within 
the country.</p>
<p>Despite the low number of refugees in the country, anti-refugee 
sentiment increased dramatically during the year. Public perception 
toward the regional refugee and migrant crisis switched from initial 
empathy and a lukewarm reception to growing hostility due to increasing 
anti-migrant rhetoric within the public sphere. According to a national 
poll by INSCOP Research, almost 90 percent of the public would not agree
 to hosting refugees in their community. The poll had a 3 percent margin
 of error. In February an NGO attempted to build a small refugee shelter
 in Ardud, a town in the north of the country but gave up after 
residents protested and signed a petition against it. In April residents
 of Vama Veche, a popular seaside resort, protested the building of a 
government transit center there. The extreme-right party Noua Dreapta 
(New Right) was very active and vocal in protesting the establishment of
 such centers.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries of international protection continued to face problems 
with local integration, including accessing housing, employment, 
education, vocational training adapted to their specific needs, 
counseling programs, and citizenship information. Obtaining a legal work
 contract remained difficult for various reasons, including tax 
concerns. Beneficiaries of subsidiary protection complained of problems 
regarding their freedom of movement to other countries due to the 
additional visa requirements. Persons granted refugee status may apply 
for citizenship after four years of continuous legal residence in the 
country. These conditions, however, do not apply to persons under 
subsidiary protection, who are required to have eight years of 
continuous legal residence.</p>
<p><u>Temporary Protection</u>: The government provided temporary 
protection to individuals who may not qualify as refugees and through 
September provided it to approximately 120 persons at the administrative
 level (statistics on persons provided temporary protection at the 
judicial level were unavailable).</p>
<h4>STATELESS PERSONS</h4>
<p>According to statistics provided to UNHCR by the General Inspectorate
 for Immigration, as of June there were 318 stateless individuals with 
valid residence documents in the country. These included legal residents
 under the aliens regime, stateless persons of Romanian origin, as well 
as 67 persons granted some form of international protection. Concerns 
remained as to the reliability of data on stateless persons in the 
country, including persons at risk of statelessness and persons of 
undetermined nationality, due to the absence of a procedure to determine
 statelessness, the absence of a single designated authority responsible
 for this purpose, and the lack of adequate identification and/or 
registration of persons with unknown or undetermined nationality.</p>
<p>Stateless persons officially registered in the country have legal 
rights depending on whether they are beneficiaries of international 
protection, alien persons with short- or long-term residence, or persons
 granted tolerated stay. Persons with tolerated stay only have the right
 to work, with a requirement to renew regularly permission to stay and 
restrictions on movement within the country. Persons in other categories
 benefit from rights similar to those of citizens, apart from political 
rights. The law includes favorable provisions for stateless persons of 
Romanian origin to reacquire citizenship. Nevertheless, a significant 
gap persisted due to the lack of safeguards against statelessness for 
children born in the country, who would be stateless because their 
parents either were themselves stateless or were foreigners unable to 
transmit their nationality.</p>
<p>In June the government amended the law on birth registration of 
Romanian nationals, simplifying late registration procedures to reduce 
the number of unregistered children, thereby ensuring them access to 
health services, social assistance, and education.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides citizens the ability to choose their government
 in free and mostly fair periodic elections held by secret ballot based 
on universal and equal suffrage.</p>
<h4>Elections and Political Participation</h4>
<p><u>Recent Elections</u>: On December 11, the country held 
parliamentary elections under a legal framework that parliament has 
revised in recent years. Logistical and other technical problems were 
minor compared with those of the 2014 presidential election. In 
September a needs assessment mission from the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europeâs Office for Democratic Institutions and Human
 Rights concluded that the government had addressed prior 
recommendations and that a full-scale observation mission was not 
required. Separately, an NGO coalition fielded more than 1,300 domestic 
observers.</p>
<p>There were minor problems with absentee ballots, some of which were 
invalidated due to technicalities (e.g., senders did not include the 
required voter affidavit). The government did not publicize the rules on
 absentee voting effectively. In some polling stations, the seals used 
to secure the voting boxes were faulty, leading some officials to use 
duct tape to close them.</p>
<p><u>Political Parties and Political Participation</u>: The law 
requires political parties to register with the Bucharest Tribunal and 
to submit their statutes, program, and a roster of at least three 
members. Critics asserted that certain requirements undermine the right 
to association. These include the requirement that parties field 
candidatesâby themselves or in allianceâin at least 75 electoral 
constituencies in two successive local elections or that they field a 
full slate of candidates in at least one county or partial slates of 
candidates in a minimum of three counties in two successive 
parliamentary elections. A partyâs statutes and program must not include
 ideas that incite war; discrimination; hatred of a national, racist, or
 religious nature; or territorial separatism.</p>
<p><u>Participation of Women and Minorities</u>: While the law does not 
restrict womenâs participation in government or politics, societal 
attitudes presented a significant barrier, and women remained 
underrepresented in positions of authority. For example, as of December 
20, there were 64 women in the 261-seat Chamber of Deputies and 20 women
 in the 136-seat Senate.</p>
<p>Under the constitution, each recognized ethnic minority is entitled 
to a representative in the Chamber of Deputies. An organization is 
required, however, to receive votes equal to 5 percent of the nationwide
 average number of votes necessary for a deputy to be elected. The list 
of organizations that benefit from these provisions is limited to those 
that are already part of a National Council of Minorities, which 
consists of organizations already in parliament. The law sets more 
stringent requirements for minority organizations without a presence in 
parliament. To participate in elections, such organizations must provide
 the Central Electoral Bureau a membership list equal to at least 15 
percent of the total number of persons belonging to that ethnic group, 
as determined by the most recent census. If this number amounts to more 
than 20,000 persons, the organization must submit a list with at least 
20,000 names distributed among a minimum of 15 counties plus the city of
 Bucharest, with no fewer than 300 persons from each county. Some 
organizations and individuals, particularly Romani individuals, have 
claimed this rule was discriminatory. There were 42 members representing
 ethnic minorities in parliament, eight in the Senate and 34 in the 
Chamber of Deputies.</p>
<p>Ethnic Hungarians, represented by the Democratic Union of Hungarians 
in Romania party, were the sole ethnic minority to gain parliamentary 
representation by surpassing the 5-percent threshold. One Romani 
organization, the Roma Party-Pro Europe, had a single representative in 
parliament.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-4" class="report__section-title">Section 4. Corruption and Lack of Transparency in Government</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The government continued a high-profile fight against 
corruption, investigating and successfully prosecuting prominent public 
officials and business leaders. Despite progress, corruption remained a 
problem according to World Bank indicators. Bribery remained common in 
the public sector. Laws were not always implemented effectively, and 
officials, including judges, sometimes engaged in corrupt practices with
 impunity. Immunity from criminal prosecution held by existing and 
former cabinet members who were also members of parliament sometimes 
blocked investigations.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: The National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) 
continued to investigate corruption cases involving political, judicial,
 and administrative officials at a steady pace throughout the year. As 
of October 31, courts had issued 264 final convictions to 676 defendants
 in cases investigated by the DNA, compared with 239 final convictions 
against 785 defendants in the same period of 2015. Among the defendants 
convicted were one minister and one deputy minister, five members of 
parliament, 12 judges, four prosecutors, 10 mayors, six generals and one
 commander from the Ministry of National Defense, and 44 police 
officers. As of October 31, DNA sent to trial 284 cases regarding 914 
defendants, 48 of whom were indicted with plea bargain agreements. These
 defendants included one former speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, 16 
members of parliament, one former minister, two deputy ministers, seven 
judges, eight prosecutors, 18 mayors, and 47 police officers. Through 
October DNA prosecutors ordered seizures worth 292 million euro ($321 
million). As of October 31, courts had ordered the forfeiture of 29.3 
million euros ($32.2 million) as a result of DNA cases. The courts 
acquitted 64 defendants through September 1. Verdicts in corruption 
cases were often inconsistent, with sentences varying widely for similar
 offenses. Enforcement of court procedures lagged mostly due to 
procedural and administrative problems, especially in regards to asset 
forfeiture.</p>
<p>Conflicts of interest, disrespect for standards of ethical conduct, 
and general improbity in public office remained problems in all three 
branches of government. Corruption was widespread in public procurement.
 In October the president signed into law a bill to provide for a 
comprehensive software mechanism to flag potential conflicts of interest
 in public procurement. Bribery was common in the public sector, 
especially in health care. Individual executive agencies were slow in 
enforcing sanctions, and agenciesâ own inspection bodies were generally 
inactive.</p>
<p>Through October 31, the DNA sent parliament six requests for pretrial
 detention of six members of parliament. Parliament approved three 
requests and denied three. The DNA asked parliament to lift immunity 
five times to investigate current and former Cabinet members. Parliament
 approved three requests and denied one, while one member of parliament 
resigned to forgo his immunity.</p>
<p>The law provides for asset forfeiture, but judges and prosecutors did
 not regularly order confiscation and authoritiesâ ability to track 
assets remained subpar. The National Agency for Fiscal Administration 
(ANAF) was charged with confiscating, managing, and liquidating assets 
acquired from criminals but was understaffed and lacked resources and 
adequate interagency coordination. In January, ANAFâs internal unit, 
formally set up in November 2015 to handle major cases of court-ordered 
confiscation, became operational. Preseizure planning between police, 
prosecutors, and ANAF, and parallel investigations (i.e., investigating a
 suspectâs financial situation simultaneously with the criminal 
investigation) did not occur in either cases of corruption or organized 
crime. In November 2015 the National Agency for Managing Seized Assets 
was created by law. In May the government adopted the agencyâs rules of 
procedure and, in subsequent months, continued to act towards making it 
operational. The agencyâs mission will be tracking, managing, and 
selling seized assets in close cooperation with law enforcement until 
ANAF can enforce the final confiscation order.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: The law empowers the National Integrity 
Agency (ANI) to administer and audit financial disclosure statements for
 all public officials and to monitor conflicts of interest. The law 
stipulates that the agency may identify âsignificant discrepanciesâ 
between an officialâs income and assets, defined as more than 45,000 lei
 ($11,000), and allows for seizure and forfeiture of unjustified assets.
 The mechanism for confiscation of âunjustified assetsâ was cumbersome. 
Through October 25, ANI identified 23 cases of âsignificant 
discrepanciesâ totaling 8.1 million lei ($1.998 million). The 23 
officials included one senator, one former member of parliament, one 
mayor, eight senior civil servants, one former senior prosecutor, one 
local councilor, and five public servants in executive positions. 
Through October 25, ANI identified 216 cases of incompatibilities, 105 
cases of conflicts of interest, 42 cases of criminal conflict of 
interest, and 15 other cases with strong indications of criminal or 
corruption offenses.</p>
<p><u>Public Access to Information</u>: Although the law provides for 
public access to government information related to official decision 
making, human rights NGOs and media reported that the government applied
 the law inadequately and inconsistently. Parliament often wrote and 
passed laws in a nontransparent manner, and the government continued to 
pass a large number of emergency ordinances. According to the 
constitution, emergency ordinances should only be used in extraordinary 
situations and cannot affect, among other issues, fundamental 
institutions or constitutional rights and liberties. In May the 
government adopted an emergency ordinance making more than 150 
modifications to the criminal code and the criminal procedure code, 
asserting that several Constitutional Court decisions related to 
provisions in the codes had to be implemented as a matter of emergency, 
as well as to comply with EU directives. The government sought 
parliamentary support, but did not receive it. Civil society protested 
the way in which the ordinance was adopted, noting that the text had not
 been made public, that some provisions infringed upon fundamental 
rights and freedoms, and that a number of Constitutional Court decisions
 were already undergoing the parliamentary process for adoption.</p>
<p>Procedures for releasing information were arduous and varied greatly 
by public institution. Many agencies did not make public their annual 
performance reports as required by law. NGOs and journalists continued 
to sue in court regularly to gain access to official government 
information. In July amendments to the law on access to public 
information took effect, expanding coverage of the law to political 
parties, public utility associations and operators, and sports 
federations. Also in July, the government adopted a resolution to 
streamline, update, and align with current communication technology the 
implementation rules for the 2001 law on access to public information 
and to standardize the manner in which agencies release such 
information. The measure includes provisions mandating that agencies 
enable access to their webpages to persons with vision or cognitive 
disabilities. The Ministry for Public Consultation and Civic Dialogue 
acted to increase the transparency of government operations and 
policy-making, including by starting the process of establishing a 
single registry for transparency of interests.</p>
<p>Representatives of several media outlets such as Press One, EurActiv,
 and Timpolis complained that the government refused to provide them the
 public information they requested on the mission of the National 
Security Science Academy (ASSN) and its programs, employees and 
expenses. Media claimed ASSN was a publicly sponsored ghost institution 
that funded the salaries of high-ranking politicians or officials 
connected to the security and law enforcement sectors.</p>
<p>The government often did not observe the law requiring transparency 
in governmental decision making. The Department for Online Service and 
Design in the prime ministerâs office is responsible for coordinating 
the implementation of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) action plan 
for the country in coordination with NGOs. The OGP process was somewhat 
successful in increasing the amount of open data and in teaching 
citizens how to use the data. In August the government adopted its OGP 
action plan for 2016-18.</p>
<p>Although intelligence services transferred the majority of the files 
of the communist-era Securitate intelligence service to the National 
College for the Study of the Securitate Archives, the powers of the 
college remained limited because the law does not permit it to issue 
binding verdicts on individualsâ past records as Securitate 
collaborators.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-5" class="report__section-title">Section 5. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A number of domestic and international human rights groups 
generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
generally met with human rights NGOs and were cooperative and sometimes 
responsive to their views. There were limited reports that government 
officials were reluctant to cooperate with NGOs that focused on 
institutionalized persons with disabilities or to accept NGO criticism 
of institutions for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p><u>Government Human Rights Bodies</u>: The Office of the Ombudsperson
 has limited power and no authority to protect citizensâ constitutional 
rights in cases requiring judicial action. Although the Office of the 
Ombudsperson is the only institution that may challenge emergency 
ordinances in the Constitutional Court, it failed to challenge several 
controversial ordinances despite persistent calls by civil society to do
 so. The ombudsperson is the national preventive mechanism implementing 
the optional protocol to the UN Convention against Torture. This gives 
the ombudsperson the power to conduct monitoring visits to places where 
individuals are deprived of their liberty, including prisons, 
psychiatric hospitals, and asylum centers. Through September the 
ombudsperson issued 23 reports with recommendations, mainly reporting on
 visits to penitentiaries.</p>
<p>Each chamber of parliament has a human rights committee tasked with 
drafting reports on bills pertaining to human rights. Members of these 
committees usually expressed the views of their political parties rather
 than addressing problems impartially.</p>
<p>The National Council for Combating Discrimination (CNCD) is the 
government agency responsible for applying domestic and EU 
antidiscrimination laws. The CNCD reports to parliament. The CNCD 
operated with the governmentâs cooperation and, for the most part, 
without government or party interference. According to the CNCD and the 
Office of the Ombudsman, neither institution received adequate 
resources. Observers generally regarded the CNCD as effective, but some 
criticized it for a lack of efficiency and political independence. While
 some observers praised the activity of the Office of the Ombudsman, 
particularly in relation to the monitoring of prisons and other closed 
institutions, most continued to regard the institution as ineffective.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-6" class="report__section-title">Section 6. Discrimination, Societal Abuses, and Trafficking in Persons</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<h4>Women</h4>
<p><u>Rape and Domestic Violence</u>: Societal views on rape remained a 
concern. A November European Commission report based on a June poll 
noted a high number of respondents suggested certain situations may 
justify nonconsensual sex. Rape, including spousal rape, is illegal. The
 law provides for three to 10 yearsâ imprisonment for rape and two to 
seven yearsâ imprisonment for sexual assault. The sentence for rape 
increases to five to 12 years if there are aggravating circumstances and
 to seven to 18 years if it led to death. For sexual assault, the 
sentence increases to three to 10 years if there are aggravating 
circumstances and to seven to 15 years if it led to death. If there are 
no aggravating circumstances and the attack did not lead to death, 
police and prosecutors may not pursue a case on their own, but they 
require a victimâs complaint, even if there is independent physical 
evidence. As a consequence, the perpetrator of a sexual assault could 
avoid punishment if the victim withdrew the complaint.</p>
<p>The criminal code classifies family violence as a separate offense 
and stipulates that when murder, battery, or other serious violence is 
committed against a family member, the penalty is increased by 
one-quarter of what it would have been otherwise. The code also states 
that if the parties reconcile, criminal liability is removed.</p>
<p>Violence against women, including spousal abuse, continued to be a 
serious problem that the government did not effectively address. The law
 provides for the issuance of restraining orders by a court for a 
maximum of six months upon the victimâs request or at the request of a 
prosecutor, the state representative in charge of protecting victims of 
family violence, or, if the victim agrees, a social service provider. 
Violation of a restraining order is punishable by imprisonment for one 
month to one year. If the parties reconcile, criminal liability is 
removed. The law requires that the court must decide on the issuance of 
the order within a three-day period. The court may also order the abuser
 to pay some of the victimâs expenses, such as the cost of the victimâs 
accommodation in a shelter or domicile apart from the abuser. The court 
may also order the abuser to undergo psychological counselling. 
Restraining orders, shelters, and other services are not available to 
victims of violence who may be in relationships but do not cohabit with 
alleged abusers.</p>
<p>While the law imposes stronger sanctions for violent offenses 
committed against family members than for similar offenses committed 
against others, the courts prosecuted very few cases of domestic abuse. 
According to official statistics, only 2 percent of complaints become 
criminal cases. Many cases were resolved before or during trial when the
 alleged victims dropped their charges or reconciled with the alleged 
abuser.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Harassment</u>: The law prohibits sexual harassment, which 
it defines as repeatedly asking for sexual favors in a work or similar 
relationship. A victim complaint is necessary to initiate a criminal 
investigation. Penalties range from fines to imprisonment of three 
months to one year. Although sexual harassment was a problem, public 
awareness of it remained low, and the crime continued to be severely 
underreported. No effective programs existed to educate the public about
 sexual harassment, and schools did not educate students on sexual 
harassment, gender violence, and gender equality.</p>
<p><u>Reproductive Rights</u>: Couples and individuals had the right to 
decide the number, spacing, and timing of their children; manage their 
reproductive health; and have access to the information and means to do 
so, free from discrimination, coercion, or violence. There were, 
nevertheless, barriers to couplesâ and individualsâ ability to maintain 
their reproductive health, including a lack of age-appropriate sex 
education for adolescents, a lack of funds allocated to contraception 
programs, and lack of a national strategy regarding sexual and 
reproductive health and rights.</p>
<p>Some women, especially Roma, had difficulty accessing reproductive 
health services for reasons that included lack of access to information,
 ethnic discrimination, lack of health insurance, and poverty.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: Under the law, women and men enjoy equal 
rights. Women experienced discrimination in marriage, divorce, child 
custody, employment, credit, pay, owning or managing businesses or 
property, education, the judicial process, and housing. The law requires
 equal pay for equal work, but there was a 7.1 percent gender pay gap, 
according to EU data. Segregation by profession exists, with women over 
represented in lower-paying jobs such as education, health care, and 
social work. Authorities did not devote significant attention or 
resources to challenges facing women. There were reports of 
discrimination in employment.</p>
<h4>Children</h4>
<p><u>Birth Registration</u>: Children derive citizenship by birth from 
at least one citizen parent. Although birth registration is mandatory by
 law, it was not universal, and authorities denied some children public 
services as a result. The most common reason for failure to register 
children at birth was the parents not declaring the childâs birth to 
authorities, sometimes because the parents lacked identity documents or 
residence papers or because the birth took place abroad in countries 
where parents were present illegally. Most such children had access to 
schools, and authorities assisted in obtaining birth documents for 
unregistered children, but the education of unregistered children 
depended on the decision of school authorities. Undocumented children 
also faced difficulties gaining access to health care. This was a 
particular problem among the Romani population, but it also occurred in 
other communities. In July parliament amended the law to simplify birth 
registration for children whose mothers do not have proper documentation
 to register their children.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: Child abuse and neglect continued to be serious 
problems, and public awareness of it remained poor. Media reported 
several severe cases of abuse or neglect in family homes, foster care, 
and child welfare institutions. The government has not established a 
mechanism to identify and treat abused and neglected children and their 
families. According to a national survey conducted by Save the Children 
Romania in 2013, 63 percent of children surveyed reported their parents 
spanked them, while 18 percent say they were hit with a stick, and 13 
percent with a belt. Some 38 percent of parents admitted to spanking 
their children, while an additional 18 percent said they used more 
severe forms of punishment.</p>
<p>According to official data, during the first quarter of the year, 
there were 3,933 cases of abuse, neglect, and exploitation of children 
recorded by child protection services throughout the country. Law 
enforcement authorities initiated a criminal investigation in only 189 
of the cases.</p>
<p><u>Early and Forced Marriage</u>: The legal age of marriage is 
officially 18 for both men and women, but the law permits minors as 
young as 16 to marry under certain circumstances. Illegal child marriage
 was reportedly common in certain social groups, particularly among some
 Romani communities. Media occasionally reported individual cases. Child
 protection authorities did not intervene in such cases. There were no 
public policies to prevent child marriage.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: The law provides one- to 
10-year prison sentences for persons convicted of sexual acts with 
minors, depending on the circumstances and the childâs age. Sexual 
intercourse with a minor who is 13 to 15 years of age is punishable by a
 one- to five-year prison sentence. Sexual intercourse with a minor 
under 13 years of age is punishable by a two- to sevenâyear prison 
sentence and deprivation of some rights. In neither case is the act 
punishable if the age difference between the perpetrator and the victim 
is less than three years. Sexual intercourse committed by an adult with a
 minor who is 15 to 18 years of age is punishable by a two- to 
seven-year prison sentence and the deprivation of some rights if the 
adult abused his or her authority or influence over the victim; the 
child was a family member; the abuse endangered the life of the minor; 
or the abuse was done with the purposes of producing pornographic 
material. If the child is younger than 15 and the same aggravating 
circumstances existed, the act is punishable by a three- to 10-year 
prison sentence and deprivation of some rights. The law also 
criminalizes sexual corruption of minors (which includes subjecting 
minors to sexual acts other than intercourse or forcing minors to 
perform such acts), luring minors for sexual purposes or child 
prostitution, and trafficking in minors. Pimping and pandering that 
involves minors incur sentences that are increased by one-half.</p>
<p>Child pornography is a separate offense and carries a sentence, 
depending on the circumstances, of up to seven yearsâ imprisonment, 
which may be increased by one-third if the perpetrator was a family 
member or someone in whose care the child was trusted or if the life of 
the child victim was endangered.</p>
<p>During the year the ECHR issued two rulings against the country for 
inadequately handling cases of child rape. In one decision,&nbsp;<i>M.G.C v. Romania</i>,
 the ECHR reviewed the case of an 11-year-old girl who was repeatedly 
raped in 2008 and 2009 by a 52-year-old man and several younger men. The
 girl became pregnant and had an abortion. The prosecution proposed and 
courts upheld fines for the younger men and sentenced the older man to 
three yearsâ imprisonment for sexual intercourse with a minor, instead 
of charging him with rape. The prosecution relied mainly on the 
statements of the perpetrators, who said the girl had acted 
provocatively and initiated the sex, as well as the fact that the girl 
did not tell her parents about it, discounting a police report that the 
girlâs age precluded the existence of valid consent and a forensic 
psychiatric report pointing to post-traumatic stress. An appellate court
 later changed the conviction to rape, but on further appeal, the 
Supreme Court reinstated the initial ruling. In the case, the ECHR also 
analyzed a large number of Romanian court decisions involving the rape 
of minors and found a failure to adopt a child-sensitive approach when 
judging such cases. The ECHR observed that âauthoritiesâ failure to 
investigate sufficiently the surrounding circumstances was the result of
 their having attached little or no weight at all to the particular 
vulnerability of young persons and the special psychological factors 
involved in cases concerning the rape of minors.â It concluded that the 
courts had not developed a settled and consistent practice to 
differentiate clearly between the crimes of rape and sexual intercourse 
with a minor.</p>
<p><u>Institutionalized Children</u>: During the year there were several
 media reports of abuses in placement centers for institutionalized 
children. Prosecutors started investigations of placement centers in 
Bucharest and Brasov for alleged abusive medication of children with 
psychiatric drugs and for neglect. In the specific centers under 
investigation, more than 50 percent of the institutionalized children 
received such medication. The ombudsperson opened an investigation in a 
placement center in Barlad for alleged sexual abuse of children, in 
particular a child with a disability.</p>
<p>In June prosecutors indicted members of an organized crime network 
who were recruiting female victims from orphanages in Iasi for sexual 
exploitation. Child neglect was a common problem in placement centers 
due to insufficient and unqualified staffing. Adequate psychological 
support was also lacking. The absence of monitoring of these centers, a 
tendency to address abuse administratively rather than through criminal 
investigations and sanctioning, and the absence of an effective 
complaint mechanism for children were other systemic problems.</p>
<p>By law unaccompanied migrant children are housed in placement 
centers, where they have access to education and other benefits other 
children receive. The NGO Jesuit Refugee Service Romania filed a 
complaint with Giurgiu child protection authorities following complaints
 from an Iraqi refugee minor in a residential facility for children. The
 child reported mental, emotional, and physical abuse against children. 
The Giurgiu child protection authority began an investigation, fired one
 employee, and sanctioned another with a 5 percent salary reduction. 
NGOs also reported that authorities placed irregular migrant children in
 administrative detention with their families if they crossed the border
 illegally and authorities determined their parents should be placed in 
detention until their situation was resolved.</p>
<p>Children with disabilities in state care were particularly vulnerable to abuse (see Persons with Disabilities).</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is a party to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs&nbsp;<i>Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction</i>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200317161748/https://travel.state.gov/content/childabduction/en/legal/compliance.html">travel.state.gov/content/childabduction/en/legal/compliance.html</a>.</p>
<h4>Anti-Semitism</h4>
<p>According to the 2011 census, the Jewish population numbered 3,271. Acts of anti-Semitism occurred during the year.</p>
<p>The law prohibits public denial of the Holocaust and fascist, racist,
 and xenophobic language and symbols, including organizations and 
symbols associated with the indigenous Legionnaire interwar fascist 
movement. The oppression of Roma as well as Jews is included in the 
definition of the Holocaust. In the first half of the year, out of 12 
cases pertaining to this law, prosecutors dismissed 11 and waived 
criminal prosecution in the remaining case.</p>
<p>Streets, organizations, and even schools or libraries continued to be
 named after persons convicted for war crimes or crimes against 
humanity, according to the Elie Wiesel Institute for the Study of the 
Holocaust in Romania. Authorities allowed demonstrations that promoted 
the Legionnaire movement. The memorial exhibition âIon Gavrila 
OgoranuâPresent!â was displayed in May in the central University Square 
of Bucharest and in the Alba Iulia National Museum. Ogoranu was a leader
 of anticommunist resistance in the first years of communism, but prior 
to that he was a member of the Legionnaire movement. The exhibition 
presented his Legionnaire past as part of an âexemplary biography.â 
Material promoting anti-Semitic views and glorifying Legionnaires also 
appeared in media, including on the internet.</p>
<p>On April 14, the National Bank of Romania issued a set of 
commemorative coins honoring three former bank governors. One of them, 
Mihail Manoilescu, who led the bank for several months in 1931, was also
 an active advocate of fascist ideology and anti-Semitism before World 
War II. The Wiesel Institute strongly protested the issuance of the 
coin. The bank stated it did not want to offend anyone and that the coin
 issuance concerned only Manoilescuâs activity as bank governor. The 
bank did not withdraw the coin but did meet with representatives of a 
foreign government to discuss how to better vet individuals who might be
 remembered in the future.</p>
<p>On April 8, a Bucharest bookstore hosted the launch of a book denying
 the Holocaust by Vasile Zarnescu, a retired SRI officer, titled&nbsp;<i>The Holocaustâthe Diabolical ScarecrowâMoney Extortion for the Holocaust</i>.
 In a media interview, Zarnescu stated that he was tasked by SRI in the 
1990s to write and publish under a pseudonym articles against the 
âpropaganda and actionsâ of Jewish community leaders. He wrote one 
specific piece against then chief rabbi Moses Rosen, who he called 
âanti-Romanianâ for monitoring the media to track anti-Semitism. The 
Center for Monitoring and Combating Anti-Semitism filed a complaint with
 the prosecutorâs office over Holocaust denial.</p>
<p>In July police learned that a monument in Brasov County commemorating
 seven members of the military (six Israelis and one Romanian) who died 
in a helicopter training exercise in 2010 was defaced with swastikas, 
graffiti, and a pig.</p>
<p>A survey by the Center for Public Opinion Polls, commissioned by the 
Wiesel Institute and released in July 2015, found that, while 73 percent
 of the 1,016 adults surveyed had heard of the Holocaust, only 34 
percent accepted as fact that the Holocaust had occurred in the country.
 Approximately 69 percent of the respondents blamed the Holocaust on 
Nazi Germany, while 19 percent considered the wartime government of 
general Ion Antonescu responsible. Of the respondents, 54 percent 
considered Antonescu a hero. The survey had a margin of error of 3 
percent. The respondents were 18 and older.</p>
<p>In December 2015 the CNCD fined Serban Suru, the self-proclaimed 
leader of the Legionnaire movement, 2,000 lei ($490) for publishing on 
his Facebook page an anti-Semitic caricature representing the Wiesel 
Instituteâs director. In the caricature, the director represented 
âJewish Nazismâ by carrying âanti-Romanian lawsâ in his bag, with a 
reference to amendments to Holocaust denial legislation that included 
the prohibition of Legionnaire symbols and organizations.</p>
<p>The government continued to implement the recommendations of the 
International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania Report of 2004. 
High-level officials, such as the president, made public statements 
against anti-Semitism. In July the Romanian Jewish Federation, together 
with the Bucharest District 3 mayorâs office, inaugurated a monument 
dedicated to the martyrs of the Bucharest Pogrom of January 1941. The 
Wiesel Institute continued to organize training courses for teachers and
 other professionals on the history of the Holocaust. In September the 
government approved the Wiesel Instituteâs hiring of three people to 
organize the creation of a future museum on the history of Jews. The 
general mayor of Bucharest agreed to make a building available to house 
the museum.</p>
<p>During the year the country held the annual chairmanship of the 
International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. On May 26 the Plenary of 
the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance voted by consensus to 
adopt a legally nonbinding working definition of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>The government introduced mention of the Holocaust in the country in 
its seventh-, eighth-, 10th-, and 12th-grade curricula. The curricula 
did not include a class on the topic as part of the general history 
curricula, however. The high school course âHistory of the Jewsâthe 
Holocaustâ remained optional, and very few schools offered it.</p>
<h4>Trafficking in Persons</h4>
<p>See the Department of Stateâs&nbsp;<i>Trafficking in Persons Report</i>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200317161748/http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/">www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/</a>.</p>
<h4>Persons with Disabilities</h4>
<p>The law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, 
sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities in employment, education,
 air travel and other transportation, access to health care, and the 
provision of other services. The government did not fully implement the 
law, and discrimination against persons with disabilities remained a 
problem.</p>
<p>In many cases persons with disabilities faced institutional and 
societal discrimination. According to a 2012 report by the EUâs Agency 
for Fundamental Rights (FRA), 1 percent of persons with mental 
disabilities had employment. The FRA report also indicated that persons 
with mental disabilities in institutional settings, in particular 
children, were subjected to various forms of bullying, harassment, and 
abuse.</p>
<p>The law mandates that buildings and public transportation be 
accessible for persons with disabilities. While the number of buildings 
with facilities for persons with disabilities increased during the year,
 the country continued to have an insufficient number of facilities 
specifically designed to accommodate persons with disabilities, who 
could have extreme difficulty navigating city streets or gaining access 
to public buildings. Persons with disabilities reported a lack of access
 to ramps, adapted public transportation, and adapted toilets in major 
buildings.</p>
<p>In May the CNCD fined the Ministry of Labor, Family, Social 
Protection, and the Elderly and the National Agency for Payments and 
Social Inspection 30,000 lei ($7,400) each for failing to fulfil their 
legal duty to enforce, including by issuing sanctions, the right of 
persons with disabilities to accessible public transportation. It also 
fined 18 municipalities, including Bucharest, 10,000 lei ($2,450) each 
for failing to make public transportation accessible for persons with 
disabilities. It fined another eight municipalities 8,000 lei ($1,960) 
each for insufficient accessibility and issued warnings to two others 
that did not fully implement accessibility measures but had made 
significant progress. This was the third year that the CNCD initiated a 
case ex officio, reviewed accessibility in large municipalities, and 
issued sanctions.</p>
<p>Discrimination against children with disabilities in education was 
also a widespread problem due to lack of adequate teacher training on 
inclusion of children with disabilities and lack of investment to make 
schools accessible. Most children with disabilities were either placed 
in special schools or not placed in school. According to a 2015 study 
conducted by the Institute for Public Policy, approximately 40 percent 
of the 70,000 children registered with disabilities were not enrolled in
 school. Of those in school, more than 60 percent were attending special
 schools. During the year the NGO European Center for the Rights of 
Children with Disabilities documented several cases of discrimination, 
abuse, and exclusion of children with disabilities from mainstream 
education. The NGO also made various complaints to the relevant 
authorities, with most cases pending a decision or a solution.</p>
<p>Persons with disabilities also faced discrimination in employment (see section 7.d.).</p>
<p>In 2014-15, the Center for Legal Resources (CRJ) made unannounced 
visits to public and private residential centers for children and young 
persons with disabilities on the basis of written protocols with the 
labor ministry. As a result of the visits, the NGO identified a series 
of violations, including verbal and physical abuse of children, 
sedation, excessive use of physical restraints, lack of hygiene, 
inadequate living conditions, and lack of adequate medical care. The CRJ
 also noted a general shortage of staff, a chronic shortage of 
specialized staff, reliance on psychiatric medication as the only 
treatment solution, segregation from communities, lack of access to 
education, absence of a complaints mechanism, and a lack of community 
living options. During the year media published or aired several 
investigations into such problems in centers for persons with 
disabilities.</p>
<p>In August the Center for Media Investigations reported on the death 
of an HIV positive young woman with disabilities living in a private 
facility operating under a government contract to provide services to 
persons with disabilities after she was transferred from state care. The
 27-year-old woman, who had spent her life in state institutions, 
weighed 74 pounds. There was reportedly no investigation into the 
circumstances of her death. The CRJ visited the center accompanied by 
the president of the National Authority for the Protection of Persons 
with Disabilities and reported finding extremely precarious living 
conditions and inadequate medical care.</p>
<p>At the end of 2015, the Center for Legal Resources and the Center for
 Media Investigations reported that approximately 4,500 persons with 
disabilities died in state care between 2010 and 2015. There were 
approximately 25,000 persons in state care in 2015.</p>
<p>The National Authority for the Protection of Persons with 
Disabilities, under the labor ministry, coordinated services for persons
 with disabilities and drafted policies, strategies, and standards in 
the field of disabilities rights.</p>
<h4>National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities</h4>
<p>Discrimination against Roma continued to be a major problem. Accurate
 numbers on the size of the Romani population were hard to pinpoint due 
to problems with identification documents, residence registration, and 
reluctance by some Roma to declare their ethnicity due to 
discrimination. Observers estimated there were between 1.8 and 2.5 
million Roma in the country, constituting approximately 10 percent of 
the total population. According to the most recent official census in 
2011, there were 621,573 Roma in the country, or 3.1 percent of the 
population.</p>
<p>Romani groups complained that harassment and police brutality, 
including beatings, were routine. Both domestic and international media 
and observers reported societal discrimination against Roma. NGOs 
reported that Roma were denied access to, or refused service in, many 
public places. Roma also experienced poor access to government services,
 a shortage of employment opportunities, high rates of school attrition,
 inadequate health care, and pervasive discrimination. A lack of 
identity documents excluded many Roma from participating in elections, 
receiving social benefits, accessing health insurance, securing property
 documents, and participating in the labor market. Roma were 
disproportionately unemployed or underemployed. Roma had a higher 
unemployment rate and a lower life expectancy than non-Roma.</p>
<p>Stereotypes and discriminatory language regarding Roma were widespread.</p>
<p>In March the ECHR issued an emergency order stopping the government 
from carrying out the third eviction in three years of a Romani 
community in Eforie. In June a trial court ordered local authorities to 
provide the Roma with houses; the ruling was not final. In 2013 local 
authorities in Eforie ordered the eviction from their homes of 
approximately 100 Roma, one-half of them children. Authorities 
immediately demolished the homes before any legal review could be 
undertaken. Some of the evicted Roma found shelter in an abandoned 
school, from which they were evicted in 2014 and taken to an overcrowded
 container settlement on the city outskirts. Because they could not 
afford to pay for water and electricity, authorities threatened to evict
 them from the containers in March, when the NGOs Romani CRISS and 
European Roma Rights Center obtained the ECHR emergency order.</p>
<p>NGOs and media reported that discrimination by teachers and other 
students against Romani students was a disincentive for Romani children 
to complete their studies. Despite an order by the Ministry of Education
 forbidding segregation of Romani students, segregation along ethnic 
lines persisted. In April the NGO Center for Human Rights and Advocacy 
published a monitoring report on segregation in 112 localities in the 
northeastern part of the country. According to the report, segregation 
occurred in at least one school in one-half of the localities monitored.
 The most common type of segregation was by classroom, followed by 
segregation by school, then by buildings within the same school, and 
then within the classroom.</p>
<p>NGO observers noted that Romani women faced both gender and ethnic 
discrimination and often lacked the training, marketable skills, or work
 experience needed to participate in the formal economy.</p>
<p>On April 8, International Roma Day, a member of the Alba-Iulia local 
council advocated that no mother should have more children than she can 
raise to avoid dependence on others, including the state. In 2013 the 
same council member advocated for the sterilization of Romani women who 
demonstrate âthey have neither the means nor the intentâ to raise 
children in adequate, âhumaneâ conditions. At the time, the CNCD fined 
him 8,000 lei ($1,960).</p>
<p>In June the CNCD fined the Sibiu mayorâs office 5,000 lei ($1,230) 
for offending the dignity of a Romani community by proposing they be 
moved outside the city, where they would âbenefit from the result of 
their labor,â implying the Roma would not work otherwise. The mayorâs 
office said this in the context of a request that this community, living
 at the outskirts of the city, be linked to the water system and be 
provided with better living conditions. The CNCD noted that the mayorâs 
office defended its position by asserting that people around the 
community had lodged complaints against the Roma for âuncivilized 
behavior.â</p>
<p>According to the 2011 census, the ethnic Hungarian population was 
approximately 1.2 million. The majority of Hungarians lived in the 
historical region of Transylvania, and they formed a majority in 
Harghita and Covasna Counties.</p>
<p>Ethnic Hungarians continued to report discrimination related mainly 
to their ability to use the Hungarian language. The law provides that, 
where a group speaking a minority language is at least 20 percent of the
 population, they have the right to use their mother tongue in dealings 
with local government. In August the political umbrella group Democratic
 Alliance of Hungarians in Romania released a report on the governmentâs
 implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority 
Languages. The report asserted that ethnic Hungarians were not permitted
 to use Hungarian in courts or administrative matters and that many 
municipalities did not use bilingual signs. The report claimed the 
government continued to refuse to establish a public Hungarian-language 
university. The report also noted inadequacies in teaching Romanian to 
children who are native Hungarian speakers, leading to underperformance 
on national examinations.</p>
<p>In February a doctor in Cluj-Napoca childrenâs hospital refused to 
give a 17-year-old ethnic Hungarian girl and her parents medical 
information in Hungarian regarding a foot injury the girl received in a 
bus accident and also refused to communicate through a translator. 
According to the law, medical information must be provided to the 
patient in a language she or he understands. The National Council for 
Combatting Discrimination issued the minimum fine of 2,000 lei ($490) to
 the hospital and 1,000 lei ($245) to the doctor. The CNCD explained it 
wanted to signal there is a problem with discrimination but did not want
 to create financial difficulties for the underfinanced medical sector. 
The hospitalâs appeal of the fine was pending at the end of September.</p>
<p>Ethnic Hungarians also complained of obstructions and bans against the use of the regional Szekler flag and symbols.</p>
<p>In the region of Moldavia, the Roman Catholic, Hungarian-speaking 
Csango minority continued to operate government-funded Hungarian 
language classes. In some other localities, authorities denied requests 
for Hungarian-language classes.</p>
<h4>Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h4>
<p>The law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. There 
are no laws, however, that address sources of discrimination against 
transgender and intersex persons. NGOs reported that police abuse and 
societal discrimination against LGBTI persons were common and that open 
hostility generally prevented the reporting of harassment and 
discrimination.</p>
<p>ACCEPT, an NGO that promoted LGBTI rights, managed an on-line legal 
counselling service. During the year ACCEPT reported that 28 out of 106 
requests for counselling were based on discrimination in employment or 
education on the grounds of sexual orientation or hate-speech against 
LGBTI persons. By mid-September, ACCEPT received two reports of police 
failing to intervene or to receive complaints from LGBTI individuals 
facing violence and abuse in Bucharest. In both cases, the perpetrators 
targeted gay men or individuals affiliated with the LGBTI community who 
were entering or leaving bars frequented by LGBTI persons.</p>
<p>Bullying remained a problem in high schools in the absence of 
discussions on diversity, equality, sexual orientation, and gender 
identity. Comprehensive sexual education programs were absent from the 
curriculum.</p>
<p>LGBTI and human rights NGOs claimed the signature-collection process 
for a pending referendum to define the family as based on a union 
between a man and woman presented irregularities and lacked 
transparency. They noted the signature collection happened in schools, 
leading to a hostile environment against LGBTI students. The NGOs also 
claimed this was a breach of education laws that ban political 
activities in schools. The Ministry of Education spokesperson declared 
the ministry issued an instruction to county school administrators about
 respecting the law. There was no monitoring or report on how this 
instruction was implemented.</p>
<p>In March ACCEPT released the results of a study on perceptions and 
attitudes related to LGBT students in high schools. The study included 
613 responses from students in 10 high schools and 157 online responses 
from self-identified LGBT students. The main results among non-LGBT 
students included: 25 percent of the students believed that gay persons 
are inferior; 50 percent would not accept a gay classmate, and 33 
percent would not accept a lesbian one; 40 percent believed gay persons 
should not teach; 20 percent would not step in if they saw violence 
against an LGBTI colleague or would even participate in the violence; 
and only 5 percent stated they would inform school leadership if they 
witnessed bullying or aggression against a colleague on account of 
sexual orientation. Of the LGBT children surveyed, 71 percent did not 
feel safe at school, particularly emotionally; 61 percent claimed they 
have been victims of or witnessed aggression; and 65 percent said their 
teachers made homophobic remarks.</p>
<p>Discrimination in employment occurred against LGBTI persons (see section 7.d.).</p>
<p>In April the ECHR decided against the state in the case of&nbsp;<i>M.C. and A.C. v. Romania</i>&nbsp;for
 failing to investigate the case of a group of youths who were severely 
beaten in 2006 after leaving a Pride parade as well as for failing to 
take into account the possible homophobic motivations of the attack.</p>
<p>Prior to the June 25 pride parade in Bucharest, which transpired 
without incident and included over 1,000 participants, approximately 50 
persons took part in a ânormalcy marchâ counterprotest sponsored by the 
extreme-right NGO New Right (Noua Dreapta), which also registered as a 
political party at the end of 2015.</p>
<p>The law governing the ability of transgender persons to change their 
identity was vague and incomplete, resulting in inconsistency in 
judicial practice concerning legal recognition of gender identity. In 
some cases authorities denied recognition of a change in identity unless
 a sex-reassignment intervention had occurred. Because of the difficult 
legal procedure for gender recognition, it was often impossible for 
transgender persons to get documents reflecting their gender identity, 
which led to difficulties in obtaining all services requiring identity 
documents (e.g., health care, transportation passes, and banking 
services). There were reports of transgender persons facing particular 
difficulties in accessing health care because doctors had very limited 
knowledge about transgender issues and, consequently, did not know how 
to treat transgender patients. There were almost no doctors who had the 
knowledge or willingness to undertake sex-reassignment surgery. Access 
to adequate psychological services was also limited because there were 
few specialists with the knowledge and expertise to deal with 
transgender issues, while others refused to accept transgender patients.</p>
<p>During the year the ACCEPT received two complaints from transgender 
persons who had changed their names through the Romanian legal system or
 an administrative body abroad, but who could not change their study 
diplomas due to a Ministry of Education order prohibiting name changes 
that occur after graduation.</p>
<p>There was a lack of training for medical staff working with the LGBTI
 community regarding communication skills, heteronormativity, 
confidentiality concerns, and discriminatory attitudes. Education in 
medical schools and in faculties of psychology on homosexuality and 
especially transgenderism was limited, with homosexuality presented in 
some faculties as a deviant behavior and illness.</p>
<h4>HIV and AIDS Social Stigma</h4>
<p>Societal discrimination against persons with HIV/AIDS was widespread.
 Although the law provides that HIV-infected persons have the right to 
confidentiality and adequate treatment, authorities rarely enforced the 
law, and discrimination against persons with HIV/AIDS impeded access to 
routine medical and dental care. Breaches of confidentiality involving 
individualsâ HIV status occurred. Incidents were severely underreported,
 and authorities did not adopt all necessary regulations to guarantee 
confidentiality and fair treatment.</p>
<p>According to a national survey conducted at the request of the CNCD 
in 2015, persons with HIV/AIDS were among the groups most subject to 
discrimination in the country. According to the survey, a majority of 
respondents indicated they would not want to be in direct contact or 
have social interactions with persons with HIV/AIDS. Only 10 percent of 
respondents would accept a person with HIV/AIDS as a relative, 16 
percent as a friend, and 14 percent as a co-worker. Some 15 percent of 
respondents would accept the idea of persons with HIV/AIDS living on the
 same street, 13 percent in the same community, and 15 percent in the 
country. Approximately 6 percent would only accept persons with HIV/AIDS
 visiting the country.</p>
<p>Observers noted that authorities failed overall to protect children 
with HIV/AIDS from widespread discrimination, abuse, and neglect. Some 
doctors reportedly refused to treat children and youths with HIV/AIDS, 
while medical personnel, school officials, and government employees did 
not always maintain the confidentiality of information about infected 
children. HIV-infected adolescents frequently experienced reduced access
 to facilities for reproductive health care and the prevention of HIV 
and sexually transmitted infections. Stigma and discrimination against 
persons with HIV/AIDS frequently impeded their access to education, 
other medical care, government services, and employment. Several 
infected persons dropped out of school due to stigmatization, 
discrimination, or disease.</p>
<p>In March the CNCD sanctioned the Ministry of Health, a private 
clinic, and one of its doctors in the case of a young person who asked 
for medical certification that he was fit to enroll in university, who 
instead received a certificate saying he was HIV-positive. The CNCD 
fined the clinic 5,000 lei ($1,230) and gave the doctor a warning for 
breach of confidentiality and limiting the victimâs right to education. 
The CNCD fined the Ministry of Health 5,000 lei for failing to adopt 
adequate instructions for medical staff on HIV/AIDS confidentiality 
standards.</p>
<h4>Promotion of Acts of Discrimination</h4>
<p>Throughout the year some local government officials made statements 
that contributed to ethnic stereotyping of Roma (see section 6, 
National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities).</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the rights of workers to form and join 
independent labor unions, bargain collectively, and conduct legal 
strikes. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination but does not require
 reinstatement of workers fired for union activity. The law provides for
 protection of freedom of association and collective bargaining, but 
unions complained there is little enforcement to protect against 
violations of these rights.</p>
<p>Employees of the Ministry of National Defense, certain categories of 
civilian employees of the Ministries of Interior and Justice, judges, 
prosecutors, intelligence personnel, and senior public servants 
including the president, parliamentarians, mayor, prime minister, 
minister, president of the Supreme Court did not have the right to 
unionize. The law does not allow certain public-sector workers, such as 
those involved in border protection, prisons, or the military, to form 
unions or strike. This includes any employee involved in 
security-related activities, which was broadly defined. Unions objected 
to the requirement that they submit lists of prospective union members 
with their registration application. Since employers also had access to 
this list, union officials feared this could lead to reprisals against 
individual unionized employees, particularly dismissals, hindering the 
formation of new unions.</p>
<p>Unions may strike only if they give employers 48 hoursâ notice. 
Although not compulsory, unions and employers often sought arbitration 
from the Ministry of Laborâs Office for Mediation and Arbitration. 
Companies may claim damages from strike organizers if a court deems a 
strike illegal. The law permits strikes only in defense of workersâ 
economic, social, and professional interests.</p>
<p>The law requires collective labor agreements to be in place for 
employers with more than 21 employees, but provides no basis for 
national collective labor agreements. Employers refusing to initiate 
negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement can receive fines. The 
law permits, but does not impose, collective labor agreements for groups
 of employers or sectors of activity. The law requires employers to 
consult with unions on such topics as imposing leave without pay or 
reducing the workweek due to economic reasons.</p>
<p>Unions complained that the governmentâs general prohibition on 
unionsâ engaging in political activities was intended to prohibit unions
 from entering unofficial agreements to support political parties. The 
law provides for this control due to past abuses by union officials, but
 the International Labor Organization Committee of Experts on the 
Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) in a 2016 report 
claimed this was at odds with the countryâs obligations under 
international conventions. Unions also complained that the government 
could exercise excessive control over union finances, although the 
government asserts that national fiscal legislation applies to all 
organizations. The CEACR also identified this as an area of concern.</p>
<p>Union representatives alleged that official reports of incidents of 
antiunion discrimination remained minimal, as it was difficult to prove 
legally that employers laid off employees in retaliation for union 
activities. The National Council for Combatting Discrimination (CNCD) 
does fine employers for antiunion discrimination, although it lacked the
 power to order reinstatement or other penalties. The law prohibits 
public authorities, employers, or organizations from interfering, 
limiting, or preventing unions from organizing, developing internal 
regulations, and selecting representatives with possible fines of 15,000
 to 20,000 lei ($3,680 to $4,910), but in recent years, the Labor 
Inspectorate, which also has jurisdiction over discrimination claims, 
has applied no such sanction. The potential fines are insufficient to 
deter violations, but employees may seek judicial remedies to order 
reinstatement.</p>
<p>The government and employers generally respected the right of 
association and collective bargaining, and union officials stated that 
registration requirements stipulated by law were complicated but 
generally reasonable.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor. 
Nevertheless, there were reports that such practices continued to occur,
 often involving Roma and children. The government did not effectively 
enforce the law and took no significant measures to prevent forced or 
compulsory labor. Penalties for forced labor included prison terms of 
one to three years and were insufficient to deter violations.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 180 of the 880 victims
 of trafficking officially identified in 2015 were exploited 
specifically for labor purposes. In 2015 police investigated 183 persons
 for forced labor, prosecuting 28 defendants for trafficking in persons 
for labor purposes and four defendants for trafficking in minors for 
forced labor purposes. On July 13, the Directorate for Investigating 
Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) uncovered a human trafficking 
gang in Berevoiesti, Arges County, which had forced dozens of kidnapped 
victims, including children, into beggary, slavery, and other forms of 
forced labor. DIICOT and media reports indicated that members of Romani 
clans kidnapped members of vulnerable social groups, including children,
 persons with mental disabilities, and those with no relatives. The 
captors allegedly kept the victims locked and chained, and beat them and
 forced them to work.</p>
<p>Men, women, and children were subjected to labor trafficking in 
agriculture, construction, domestic service, hotels, and manufacturing. 
Organized rings, often involving family members, forced persons, 
including significant numbers of Romani women and children, to engage in
 begging and petty theft (see section 7.c.).</p>
<p>On March 30, the Bucharest Court of Appeals sentenced former 
communist-era prison official, Ion Ficior, who ran a forced labor camp, 
to 20 years in prison.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The minimum age for most forms of employment is 16. Children may
 work with the consent of parents or guardians at age 15 if the 
activities do not endanger their health, morality, or safety. The law 
prohibits minors (under 18) from working in hazardous conditions, 
provides a basis for the elimination of hazardous work for children, 
includes a list of dangerous jobs, and specifies penalties for 
offenders. Some examples of hazardous jobs for children include those 
posing a high risk of accident or health risk, exposure to psychological
 or sexual risk, night shifts, exposure to harmful temperatures, and 
those requiring use of hazardous equipment. Parents whose children carry
 out hazardous activities are required to attend parental education 
programs or counseling and may be fined between 100 and 1,000 lei 
($24.50 and $245) for failing to do so. Persons or companies who employ 
children for hazardous tasks may be fined 500 to 1,500 lei ($123 to 
$368).</p>
<p>Children who work have the right to continue their education, and the
 law obliges employers to assist in this regard. Children between ages 
15 and 18 may work a maximum of six hours per day and no more than 30 
hours per week, provided their school attendance is not affected. Many 
children reportedly did not attend school while working. Minors may not 
work overtime or during the night and have the right to an additional 
three days of annual leave.</p>
<p>The law requires schools to notify social services immediately if 
children miss class to work, but schools often do not follow the law. 
Social welfare services have the responsibility to reintegrate such 
children into the educational system. The government conducted an 
information campaign during the year to raise awareness of child labor 
and childrenâs rights among children and school officials.</p>
<p>Penalties for violation of child labor laws include sentences ranging
 from one to two years or fines. Violations were rarely prosecuted and 
penalties are not sufficient to deter violations. The Ministry of Labor 
may impose fines and close factories where it finds exploitation of 
child labor. The National Authority for Child Protection (ANPC) in the 
Labor Ministry has responsibility for investigating any report of child 
labor abuse, but enforcement of child labor laws tended to be lax, 
especially in rural areas with many agricultural households and where 
social welfare services lack personnel and capacity to address child 
labor violations.</p>
<p>The ANPC is responsible for monitoring and coordinating all programs 
for the prevention and elimination of child labor. Government efforts 
focused on reacting to reported cases and it does not appear that the 
ANPC dedicated any resources to prevention programs. According to ANPC 
statistics, 214 children were subject to child labor in 2015. Of these, 
132 cases occurred in urban areas and 82 cases in rural areas; 103 cases
 involved girls and 111 involved boys; 170 of the children were under 
14, while 44 were between ages 14 and 18. The incidence of child labor 
was likely much higher than official statistics reflected. Child labor, 
including begging, selling trinkets on the street, and washing 
windshields, remained widespread in Romani communities, especially in 
urban areas. Children as young as five engaged in such activities. Of 
the 214 documented cases of child labor violations in 2015, authorities 
prosecuted only 12 alleged perpetrators.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>Labor laws and regulations prohibit discrimination with respect 
to employment and occupation because of race, sex, gender, age, 
religion, disability, language, sexual orientation or gender identity, 
HIV-positive status or other communicable diseases, or social status. 
The government did not enforce these laws effectively, and only reacted 
to claims of discrimination and did not adequately engage in programs to
 prevent discrimination. Although the CNCD and the Labor Inspectorate 
investigated reported cases of discrimination, the penalties were 
insufficient to deter violations. The penalties for discrimination with 
respect to employment and occupation include fines between 400 and 4,000
 lei ($98 and $980) if the discrimination refers to one individual, or 
between 600 and 8,000 lei ($147 and $1,960) if the discrimination 
targets group of individuals or communities.</p>
<p>Discrimination in employment or occupation occurred with respect to 
gender, disability, and HIV-positive status. There was also 
discrimination against Roma and migrant workers. In the first six months
 of the year, the CNCD processed 187 discrimination cases with respect 
to employment, of which 18 concluded with various penalties, mostly 
fines. The CNCD addressed cases in both the public (local public 
administration, pubic media, and communications) and private sectors 
(food, energy, transportation companies). The government largely reacted
 to complaints and did not engage in adequate programs to prevent 
discrimination.</p>
<p>According to Eurostat, the salary gap between men and women in the 
country was 10 percent in 2014. While the law provides female employees 
re-entering the workforce after maternity leave the right to return to 
their previous or a similar job, pregnant women and other women of 
childbearing age could still suffer unacknowledged discrimination in the
 labor market.</p>
<p>Although systematic discrimination against people with disabilities 
did not exist, the public at large had a bias against those with 
disabilities. NGOs worked actively to change attitudes and assist those 
with disabilities to gain skills and employment, but the government 
lacked adequate programs to prevent discrimination and promote 
integration.</p>
<p>The LGBTI rights group Accept received reports of eight cases of 
employment discrimination against LGBTI persons and guided the 
complainants in possible courses of action. One case was resolved after 
the complainant filed an internal complaint with the employer in June; 
three other individuals refused to appeal to the CNCD or the courts due 
to concerns about further harassment, preferring settlements with their 
employers.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>Effective May 1, the monthly gross minimum wage increased to 
1,250 lei ($307). According to Eurostat data, the annual individual 
income level for persons âat risk of the poverty thresholdâ was 1,388 
euros ($1,530) for a single-person household in 2015. The law provides 
for equal pay for equal work.</p>
<p>The law provides for a standard workweek of 40 hours or five days. 
Workers are entitled to overtime pay for weekend or holiday work or work
 of more than 40 hours, which may not exceed 48 hours per week, averaged
 for the month. The law requires a 24-hour rest period in the workweek, 
although most workers received two days off per week. During reductions 
of workplace activity for economic or technical reasons, the law allows 
employers to shorten an employeeâs workweek and reduce the associated 
salary. Excessive overtime may lead to fines on employers if workers 
file a complaint, but complaints were rare. The law prohibits compulsory
 overtime.</p>
<p>The law gives employers wide discretion regarding performance-based 
evaluation of employees. The law permits 90-day trial periods for new 
employees and simplifies termination procedures during this probationary
 period.</p>
<p>The law provides for temporary and seasonal work and sets penalties 
for work performed without a labor contract in either the formal or the 
informal sector of the economy. Penalties for employers using illegal 
labor range from fines between 500 lei and 1,000 lei ($123 and $245) for
 cases involving fewer than five persons to imprisonment in cases of 
more than five persons. The maximum duration of a temporary contract is 
24 months, which may be extended as long as the total contract length 
does not exceed 36 months, in accordance with EU regulations.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor, through the Labor Inspectorate, is responsible
 for enforcing the law on working conditions, health and safety, and 
minimum wage rates. The inspectorate has 1,400 inspectors to cover over 
550,000 employers with more than 5.5 million employees. Of the 1,400 
inspectors, approximately 900 cover labor relations, including issues 
related to work contracts, collective bargaining, minimum wage, with the
 other inspectors addressing workplace health and safety issues. The 
inspectorate was understaffed and inspectors underpaid; consequently, 
the inspectorate has high turnover and limited capacity. Minimum wage, 
hours of work, and occupational safety and health standards were not 
effectively enforced in all sectors.</p>
<p>According to trade union reports, many employers paid supplemental 
salaries under the table to reduce both employeesâ and employersâ tax 
burdens. This practice decreased employeesâ future pensions and limited 
their ability to obtain credit from banks and other lenders. To address 
underreported labor, the Labor Inspectorate collaborated with the 
National Authority for Fiscal Administration to conduct a joint 
operation from June 16 to September 23, in which the labor and fiscal 
inspectors jointly checked employers in sectors prone to underreported 
labor, including the textile, construction, security, cleaning, food 
preparation, transportation, and storage industries.</p>
<p>The government did not effectively enforce overtime standards. Union 
leaders complained that overtime violations were the main problem facing
 their members, since employers often required employees to work longer 
than the legal maximum without always receiving mandatory overtime 
compensation. This practice was especially prevalent in the textile, 
banking and finance, and construction sectors. Penalties for violations 
ranged from 300 lei ($74) for minor violations to up to 100,000 lei 
($24,600) for more serious violations.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor is responsible for establishing occupational, 
health, and safety standards, and the Labor Inspectorate inspects 
employers for compliance with regulations. The high number of violations
 indicated that the penalties did not deter violations. From January to 
June, labor inspectors conducted more than 37,000 inspections and 
sanctioned more than 9,000 employers for violations related to labor 
conditions, including unreported or undeclared labor, imposed and 
unremunerated overtime, payment below the gross minimum wage, and 
unremunerated work on holidays. During this same period, inspectors 
focusing on workplace safety inspected more than 27,000 employers, 
issued almost 2,500 fines, and applied various sanctions ranging from 
remedial recommendations to workplace or equipment suspension against 
20,000 employers. Workers could remove themselves from situations that 
endanger health or safety without jeopardy to their employment. Union 
leaders complained that labor inspectors only superficially investigated
 workplace accidents, including incidents involving fatalities, and that
 inspectors wrongly concluded that the victims caused most fatal 
accidents. The Labor Inspectorate lacked sufficient personnel to carry 
out its responsibilities effectively.</p>
