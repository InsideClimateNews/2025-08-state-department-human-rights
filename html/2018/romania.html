				<p>Romania is a constitutional republic with a democratic, 
multiparty parliamentary system. The bicameral parliament consists of 
the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, both elected by popular vote. 
The country held parliamentary elections in 2016 that observers 
generally considered to be free and fair and without irregularities. In 
2014 the country held presidential elections in which electoral 
observers noted irregularities, including insufficient polling stations 
for the large diaspora community.</p>
<p>Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the security forces.</p>
<p>Human rights issues included endemic official corruption and police violence against the Roma.</p>
<p>The judiciary took steps to prosecute and punish officials who 
committed abuses, but authorities delayed proceedings involving alleged 
police abuse. The result was that many of the cases ended in acquittals.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings.</p>
<p>The Institute for Investigating Communist Crimes and the Memory of 
the Romanian Exile (IICCMRE) was authorized to submit criminal 
complaints related to alleged communist-era crimes. On June 25, the 
IICCMRE submitted a criminal complaint to the Prosecutorâs Office on 
alleged inhumane treatment between 1980 and 1989 in the Siret 
Neuropsychological Pediatric Hospital that resulted in 340 deaths.</p>
<p>In May 2017 the trial began of former communist-era Securitate 
officials Marin Parvulescu, Vasile Hodis, and Tudor Postelnicu, accused 
of crimes against humanity before the Bucharest Court of Appeals. They 
were charged in the death of dissident Gheorghe Ursu, who was arrested 
and allegedly beaten to death by investigators and cellmates in 1985. As
 of September the case was before the Bucharest Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>In 2016 the Military Prosecutorâs Office indicted former president 
Ion Iliescu, former prime minister Petre Roman, former vice prime 
minister Gelu Voican Voiculescu, and former Romanian Intelligence 
Service director Virgil Magureanu for crimes against humanity. They were
 accused of involvement in the 1990 âminersâ riot,â when thousands of 
miners were brought to Bucharest to attack demonstrators opposed to 
Iliescuâs rule. According to official figures, the violence resulted in 
hundreds of injuries, illegal arrests, and four deaths. Media estimates 
of the number injuries and deaths were much higher. As of September the 
case was pending before the High Court of Cassation and Justice.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Disappearance</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law prohibit such practices, but there were
 reports from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and media that police
 and gendarmes mistreated and abused prisoners, pretrial detainees, 
Roma, and other vulnerable persons, including homeless persons, women, 
sex workers, and substance users, primarily with excessive force, 
including beatings. In one example, according to journalists, in 
September four agents of the Bucharest Sector 3 police used excessive 
force against two Romani teenagers caught fishing in a public park. As 
of September a police disciplinary committee was investigating the case.</p>
<p>In February prosecutors in Bucharest Sector 5 opened a case against 
15 employees and the director of the Rahova Penitentiary Hospital for 
allegedly beating several inmates between 2015 and 2018 and falsifying 
medical records to cover up the abuses. As of October the investigation 
of 16 defendants and seven suspects was pending.</p>
<p>The NGO Romani Center for Social Intervention and Studies stated that
 in 43 cases of police brutality against Roma persons over the previous 
12 years, there were no convictions at the national level, often because
 prosecutors did not take the cases to court. The European Court of 
Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in a number of cases that the justice system 
had failed to deliver a just outcome in cases of police brutality, 
particularly against Roma, and cases involving abuses in psychiatric 
hospitals. The average time for a ruling in cases of alleged police 
abuse of Roma was nearly four years.</p>
<p>In 2015 the Association for the Defense of Human Rights-Helsinki 
Committee (ADHR-HC) reported that the Romani community in the village of
 Racos in Brasov County complained that police had terrorized and 
repeatedly beaten them over the previous three years. The Brasov 
prosecutorâs office allegedly handled their complaints improperly. In 
addition, four men reportedly beat a civil activist who was advising 
members of the community on how to submit complaints. The prosecutorâs 
office attached to the Brasov Tribunal sent to trial several defendants,
 including the chief of the Racos police, for inciting others to hit the
 victims and other acts of violence against the civil activist. In 
September 2017 and July 2018, the Rupea Court convicted the defendants 
to prison sentences and criminal fines for assault.</p>
<p>According to the United Nations, two allegations of sexual 
exploitation and abuse against peacekeepers from Romania reported in 
2017 were pending. Both cases involve military observers deployed in UN 
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. One case 
involved the alleged sexual abuse (rape) of a minor. The peacekeeper in 
question was repatriated by the United Nations. The other case involved 
alleged sexual exploitation (transactional sex). Investigations by 
Romanian authorities were pending.</p>
<h4>Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h4>
<p>Prison conditions remained harsh and overcrowded and did not meet 
international standards. The abuse of prisoners by authorities and other
 prisoners reportedly continued to be a problem.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: According to official figures, 
overcrowding was a problem, particularly in those prisons that did not 
meet the standard of 43 square feet per prisoner set by the Council of 
Europe. Conditions remained generally poor within the prison system, and
 observers noted insufficient spending on repair and retrofitting. 
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, men and women, juveniles 
and adults, and pretrial detainees and convicted persons were not held 
together.</p>
<p>According to media, NGO, and ombudsperson reports, guards assaulted 
prisoners and, at times, prisoners assaulted and abused fellow inmates. 
As of September, 74 complaints against penitentiary staff had been 
lodged with the National Penitentiary Authority (NPA) for abuses and 
violations of inmatesâ rights, acts of corruption, threats, failures in 
executing professional duties, mistreatment, and inappropriate behavior.
 Statistics on the number of complaints sent by the NPA or inmates to 
prosecutors were not available.</p>
<p>A number of prisons provided insufficient medical care, and food 
quality was poor and sometimes insufficient in quantity. In some prisons
 heating and ventilation were inadequate. Persons with mental disorder 
did not receive sufficient care and were frequently isolated by other 
inmates. The ADHR-HC stated that the actual number of persons who had 
mental health problems was three times higher than the number of inmates
 who received treatment for mental illness.</p>
<p>The ADHR-HC stated that most pretrial detention facilities had 
inadequate conditions, particularly in terms of hygiene and 
overcrowding. Such facilities were often located in basements and had no
 natural light and inadequate sanitation. In some pretrial facilities 
and prisons, there was no possibility for confidential meetings between 
detainees and their families or attorneys. The ADHR-HC also criticized 
the lack of adequate treatment for former drug addicts and the lack of 
HIV and hepatitis prevention measures.</p>
<p>In April 2017 the ECHR issued a pilot judgment regarding prison and 
detention center conditions in the country. The court had previously 
dealt with more than 150 complaints of overcrowding and inadequate 
conditions in prisons and pretrial detention facilities. It found that 
the applicantsâ situation was part of a general pattern of structural 
dysfunction of the system.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: Independent authorities did not always investigate credible allegations of inhuman conditions.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: The government permitted monitoring 
visits by independent human rights observers, and such visits occurred 
during the year. The ombudsperson also visited prisons as part of his 
mandate to monitor places of confinement.</p>
<p><u>Improvements</u>: The law provides for reducing sentences for 
prisoners held in inappropriate conditions. Under its provisions, for 
each 30 days a prisoner has been held since 2012 in inappropriate 
conditions, his/her sentence is reduced by six days. Inappropriate 
conditions are those not meeting standards set by the Council of Europe 
or other conditions as defined by law, including having less than 43 
square feet of living space per prisoner, dampness or mold in the walls,
 and lack of private toilets. Between October 2017 and June 2018, 10,957
 inmates were released based on the provisions of this law.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and 
detention, and the government generally respected these prohibitions. 
The law provides for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness
 of his or her detention.</p>
<h4>ROLE OF THE POLICE AND SECURITY APPARATUS</h4>
<p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs is responsible for the General 
Inspectorate of the Romanian Police, gendarmerie, border police, General
 Directorate for Internal Protection (DGPI), and Directorate General for
 Anticorruption. The DGPI has responsibilities for intelligence 
gathering, counterintelligence, and preventing and combatting 
vulnerabilities and risks that could seriously disrupt public order or 
target Ministry of Internal Affairs operations. The prime minister 
appoints the head of DGPI. The Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI), the 
domestic security agency, investigates terrorism and national security 
threats. The president nominates and the parliament confirms the SRI 
director.</p>
<p>Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the SRI and 
the security agencies that reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
 The government did not have effective mechanisms to investigate and 
punish abuse, and impunity was a problem.</p>
<p>More than 770 persons submitted criminal complaints concerning 
violent incidents during a protest on August 10 when the gendarmerie 
allegedly used excessive force against peaceful protesters. On August 
19, the minister of interior announced the ministryâs report concerning 
the protest was classified. On September 25, the General Prosecutorâs 
Office stated the declassification of documents was required so that 
parties, suspects, and lawyers could have access to them. As of November
 the report had not been declassified.</p>
<p>Police officers were frequently exonerated in cases of alleged 
beatings and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. A widespread 
perception of police corruption contributed to citizensâ lack of respect
 for police. Low salaries also contributed to making individual law 
enforcement officials susceptible to bribery. Authorities referred cases
 of high-level corruption to the Directorate General for Anticorruption 
in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.</p>
<h4>ARREST PROCEDURES AND TREATMENT OF DETAINEES</h4>
<p>By law only judges may issue detention and search warrants, and the 
government generally respected this provision. Authorities must inform 
detainees at the time of their arrest of the charges against them and 
their legal rights, including the right to remain silent and the right 
to an attorney. Police must notify detainees of their rights in a 
language they understand before obtaining a statement and bring them 
before a court within 24 hours of arrest. Although authorities generally
 respected these requirements, there were some reports of abuses during 
the year. Pending trial, if the alleged offender does not pose any 
danger to conducting the trial, there is no concern of flight or 
commission of another crime, and the case does not present a âreasonable
 suspicionâ that the person would have committed the offense, the 
investigation proceeds with the alleged offender at liberty. Depending 
on the circumstances of the case, the law allows home detention and 
pretrial investigation under judicial supervision, meaning that the 
person accused must report regularly to law enforcement. A bail system 
also exists but was seldom used. Detainees have the right to counsel 
and, in most cases, had prompt access to a lawyer of their choice. 
Authorities provided indigent detainees legal counsel at public expense.
 The arresting officer is also responsible for contacting the detaineeâs
 lawyer or, alternatively, the local bar association to arrange for a 
lawyer. A detainee has the right to meet privately with counsel before 
the first police interview. A lawyer may be present during the interview
 or interrogation.</p>
<p>The law allows police to take an individual to a police station 
without a warrant for endangering others or disrupting public order. 
Police reportedly used this provision to hold persons for up to 24 
hours. Since those held in such cases were not formally detained or 
arrested, authorities did not recognize their right to counsel. The 
ADHR-HC criticized this provision as leaving room for abuse.</p>
<p><u>Pretrial Detention</u>: A judge may order pretrial detention for 
up to 30 days. A court may extend this period in 30-day increments up to
 a maximum of 180 days. Under the law detainees may hold courts and 
prosecutors liable for unjustifiable, illegal, or abusive measures.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>Lack of sufficient personnel, physical space, and technology to 
enable the judiciary to act swiftly and efficiently continued, resulting
 in excessively long trials.</p>
<p>The constitution provides for an independent judiciary. The Superior 
Council of Magistrates is the countryâs judicial governance body and is 
responsible for protecting judicial independence. It generally 
maintained transparency of operations and acted to suspend judges and 
prosecutors suspected of legal violations. There were reports, however, 
that the Judicial Inspectorate, an autonomous disciplinary unit within 
the council, was subject to increasing political influence and was 
occasionally used to investigate magistrates prosecuting or ruling 
against the governing coalitionâs officials or allies.</p>
<p>The government generally respected judicial independence and 
impartiality, but instances of political messaging targeting courts, 
prosecutors, or judges increased. Some prosecutors and judges complained
 to the council that media outlets and politiciansâ statements damaged 
their professional reputations. The council determined some politiciansâ
 public statements infringed on judicial independence.</p>
<h4>TRIAL PROCEDURES</h4>
<p>The constitution and the law provide for the right to a fair and 
public trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this 
right.</p>
<p>Under the law defendants enjoy the right to the presumption of 
innocence, have the right to be informed promptly and in detail of the 
charges against them, and have the right to free linguistic 
interpretation as necessary from the moment charged through all appeals.
 Trials should take place without undue delay, but delays were common 
due to heavy caseloads or procedural inconsistencies. Defendants have 
the right to be present at trial. The law provides for the right to 
counsel and the right to consult an attorney in a timely manner. The law
 requires that the government provide an attorney to juveniles in 
criminal cases; the Ministry of Justice paid local bar associations to 
provide attorneys to indigent clients. Defendants may confront or 
question witnesses against them (unless the witness is an undercover 
agent) and present witnesses and evidence on their own behalf. The law 
generally provides for the right of defendants and their attorneys to 
view and consult case files, but prosecutors may restrict access to 
evidence for such reasons as protecting the victimâs rights and national
 security. Both prosecutors and defendants have a right of appeal. 
Defendants may not be compelled to testify against themselves and have 
the right to abstain from making statements. Prosecutors may use any 
statements by defendants against them in court.</p>
<p>The law allows for home detention using electronic monitoring 
devices, but the government did not procure such devices, and persons 
were placed under home detention without them. A judge may detain a 
person for up to five years during a trial, which is deducted from the 
prison sentence if the person is convicted.</p>
<h4>POLITICAL PRISONERS AND DETAINEES</h4>
<p>There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees.</p>
<h4>CIVIL JUDICIAL PROCEDURES AND REMEDIES</h4>
<p>Civil courts are independent and function in every jurisdiction. 
Judicial and administrative remedies are available to individuals and 
organizations for violations of human rights by government agencies. 
Plaintiffs may appeal adverse judgments involving alleged violations of 
human rights by the state to the ECHR after exhausting the avenues of 
appeal in domestic courts.</p>
<p>Approximately 80 percent of court cases were civil cases. Caseloads 
were distributed unevenly, resulting in vastly different efficiency 
rates in different regions. A lack of both jurisprudence and a modern 
case management system contributed to a high number of appeals as well 
as lengthy trials. Litigants sometimes encountered difficulties 
enforcing civil verdicts because the procedures for enforcing court 
orders were unwieldy and prolonged.</p>
<h4>PROPERTY RESTITUTION</h4>
<p>According to the National Authority for Property Restitution (ANRP), 
the Jewish community is entitled to receive compensation for buildings 
and land that belonged to the Judaic religious denomination or legal 
entities of the Jewish community that were confiscated between September
 6, 1940, and December 22, 1989. Individuals are entitled to 
compensation only for real estate confiscated between 1945 and 1989. The
 government has laws and/or mechanisms in place to address Holocaust-era
 property claims, and NGOs and advocacy groups reported some progress on
 resolution of such claims.</p>
<p>The law for returning property seized by the former communist and 
fascist regimes includes a âpointsâ system to compensate claimants where
 restitution of the original property is not possible. Claimants may use
 the points to bid in auctions of state-owned property or exchange them 
for monetary compensation. The parliament intended the law to speed up 
restitution, but local authorities hindered property restitution by 
failing to complete a land inventory stipulated by law. The government 
twice extended the deadline for the inventoryâs completion.</p>
<p>There were numerous disputes over church buildings and property that 
the Romanian Orthodox Church failed to return to the Greek Catholic 
Church, despite court orders to do so. The government did not take 
effective action to return churches confiscated by the post-World War II
 communist government. There continued to be lengthy delays in 
processing claims related to properties owned by national minority 
communities. Under the law there is a presumption of abusive transfer 
that applies to restitution of private property but not to religious or 
communal property. In many cases documents attesting to the abusive 
transfer of such properties to state ownership no longer existed. 
Religious and national minorities are not entitled to compensation for 
nationalized buildings that were demolished.</p>
<p>Associations of former owners asserted that the points compensation 
system was ineffective and criticized the restitution law for failing to
 resolve cases fairly and for lengthy delays and corruption. While the 
pace of resolving restitution cases at the administrative level 
increased, the number of properties returned involving churches and 
national minorities was disproportionately low. As of September the 
government had approved the restitution of 14 properties to religious 
denominations, approved compensation in 28 cases, and rejected 376 other
 claims. In 111 cases the filers withdrew, redirected, or attached their
 claims to other files. The number of cases resolved each year has 
remained approximately constant over the past three years, (an average 
of 1,300), but the number of positive decisions remained extremely low. 
Religious communities disputing these rulings continued having to go to 
court and incur additional costs. As of September there were 6,617 
pending requests for restitution from religious denominations.</p>
<p>According to advocates of the Romanian Jewish community, the 
disappearance of entire document repositories, combined with limited 
access to other archives, prevented the Jewish community from filing 
certain claims before the legal deadlines. The ANRP rejected most 
restitution claims concerning former Jewish communal properties during 
its administrative procedure. The Caritatea Foundation, established by 
the Federation of Jewish Communities in Romania and World Jewish 
Restitution Organization (WJRO) to claim communal properties, reported 
it challenged these negative ANRP decisions in court. The WJRO also 
reported that the restitution of heirless private Jewish properties was 
not completed and that there was insufficient research concerning 
property that had belonged to Jewish victims of the Holocaust.</p>

					<p>Although the constitution and law prohibit such actions, there 
were accusations by NGOs, politicians, and journalists that authorities 
failed to respect these prohibitions.</p>

Facebook page an official document purporting to be a psychiatric 
diagnosis of a prominent antigovernment protester.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Speech and Press</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution provides for freedom of expression, including 
for the press, and the government partially respected this right. 
Independent organizations such as Media Monitoring Agency, Freedom 
House, and Center for Independent Journalism noted excessive 
politicization of the media, corrupt financing mechanisms, and editorial
 policies subordinated to owner interests.</p>
<p><u>Freedom of Expression</u>: The law prohibits denying the Holocaust
 and promoting or using the symbols of fascist, racist, xenophobic, or 
Legionnaire ideologies, the latter being the nationalist, extremist, 
anti-Semitic interwar movement that was among the perpetrators of the 
Holocaust in the country.</p>
<p><u>Press and Media Freedom</u>: While independent media were active 
and expressed a wide variety of views without overt restriction, 
politicians or persons with close ties to politicians and political 
groups either owned or indirectly controlled numerous media outlets at 
the national and local levels. The news and editorial stance of these 
outlets frequently reflected their ownersâ views and targeted criticism 
at political opponents and other media organizations.</p>
<p>Mass demonstrations in Bucharest on August 10 sharply criticized the 
governmentâs performance on curbing corruption. According to watchdogs 
and independent reports, progovernment media played a key role in 
spreading misinformation during the demonstrations. Representatives of 
the governing party claimed that the August 10 protests were sponsored 
from abroad and aimed to be a coup dâetat. They presented no evidence to
 support these claims.</p>
<p>The National Audiovisual Council (CNA) and Council Fighting 
Discrimination (CNCD) avoided sanctioning unprofessional and unethical 
behavior by media outlets controlled by businessmen and politicians 
related to the ruling party, while sanctioning reporters criticizing the
 government. For example, in January the CNCD fined both Republica 
analyst Cristian Tudor Popescu and Digi24 TVâs Cosmin Prelipceanu 1,000 
lei ($250), for criticizing the hairdo of the newly appointed prime 
minister and for refusing to retract the remark. On June 19, the 
Bucharest Court of Appeals cancelled the CNCD decision on the grounds 
that it violated freedom of expression.</p>
<p>During the year media outlets, anchors, and commentators controlled 
by owners who were connected to the government and ruling parties 
criticized press outlets whose coverage was critical of the ruling 
parties and their proposed legal curbs on magistratesâ powers.</p>
<p><u>Violence and Harassment</u>: More than 20 civic and human rights 
NGOs condemned the June 20 use of violence by the gendarmerie against 
peaceful protesters, including the detention of a German reporter.</p>
<p>On August 10, at least 15 journalists suffered physical, verbal, or 
tear gas assaults by gendarmes while monitoring a major anticorruption, 
antigovernment protest taking place in Bucharest, according to Active 
Watch, Reporters Without Borders, the Helsinki Committee for Human 
Rights, and the International and the European Federations of 
Journalists. According to NGOs, media reports, and testimonies, the 
journalists abused by gendarmes included Robert Mihailescu (Hotnews.ro),
 Cristian Stefanescu (Deutsche Welle), Vlad Ursulean (Casa 
Jurnalistului), Ioana Moldovan (Documentaria.ro), Silviu Matei 
(Agerpres), Cristian Popa and Cristi Ban (Digi 24), and Robert 
Reinprecht and Ernst Gelegs (Austrian public television).</p>
<p>On November 8, invoking privacy legislation, the National Supervisory
 Authority for Personal Data Processing (ANSPCP) asked investigative 
media group Rise Project to disclose the sources of the information they
 used for the articles they published into suspected cases of fraud and 
corruption with public money. Reportersâ articles referred to TelDrum, a
 company based in Teleorman County, allegedly connected to the Chamber 
of Deputies speaker, who is also the chair of the ruling party, PSD. 
ANSPCP threatened the group with an unprecedented penalty of a 20 
million euro ($23 million) fine if it did not provide access to their 
databases and ongoing investigations. It was the second consecutive year
 that Rise Project was subject to harassment by government agencies 
after it started thorough investigations into the assets of the ruling 
party chair and his family.</p>
<p><u>Libel/Slander Laws</u>: On May 13, Chamber of Deputies speaker 
Liviu Dragnea announced that he had requested authorities investigate 
G4Media.ro reporter Dan Tapalaga, claiming he had revealed a classified 
memorandum on the possible move of the countryâs embassy to Jerusalem. 
G4Media was able to show that the report was based on open sources.</p>
<p>Voluntari Mayor Florin Pandele sued the news outlet PressOne.ro after
 the magazine disclosed academic evidence that he and dozens of other 
officials plagiarized their Ph.D. theses, after which the granting 
university rescinded his degree. Pandele was claiming damages of 300,000
 euros ($339,000) for defamation. On November 20, the High Court of 
Cassation and Justice sent the case back to the appellate court, ruling 
that its previous rejection of Pandeleâs second appeal was ânot 
convincing.â After another appellate court ruling, the case could return
 to the High Court for a final ruling.</p>
<h4>INTERNET FREEDOM</h4>
<p>The government did not systematically restrict or disrupt access to 
the internet or censor online content, and there were no credible 
reports that the government monitored private online communications 
without appropriate legal authority. According to the International 
Telecommunication Union, 64 percent of the population used the internet 
in 2017.</p>
<p>In January media outlets reported that police opened two criminal 
cases against individuals in Timisoara who were accused of âinstigatingâ
 unrest in Facebook messages in connection with antigovernment protests 
in December 2017. The human rights NGO Societatea Timisoara reported 
that the police action was aimed at intimidating street protesters 
mobilizing for democracy.</p>
<p>On July 19, media and NGOs criticized the Judicial Inspection of the 
Superior Council of Magistrates for initiating a disciplinary 
investigation against prosecutor Alexandra Lancranjan for a Facebook 
post explaining European legislation relating to abuse of office.</p>
<p><u>National Security</u>: On June 26, the European Court of Human 
Rights (ECHR) found that the arrest of journalist Marian Girleanu in 
2006 was disproportionate and constituted an interference with his right
 to freedom of expression. The court order the state pay 4,500 euros 
($5,180) to the journalist and 3,695 euros ($4,250) to his lawyer. 
Girleanu was arrested and fined in 2006 for sharing classified military 
information without publishing it. At the time Girleanu was working for 
the daily newspaper&nbsp;<i>Romania Libera,</i>&nbsp;pursuing investigations into the armed forces and police.</p>
<h4>ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND CULTURAL EVENTS</h4>
<p>Media outlets and NGOs accused the Vrancea Popular Atheneum, a 
cultural events venue sponsored by the Focsani municipality, of 
cancelling a planned conference in February on womenâs empowerment and 
gender equality organized by high school students because one of the 
speakers was transgender. The Vrancea Bar Association, a county 
councilor, the Vrancea School Inspectorate, the âParents for Religion 
Classesâ Association, and the Vrancea and Buzau Archbishopric intervened
 to block the conference and attempted to dissuade the organizers from 
holding it. In a statement to media, the director of the Athenaeum 
asserted, âWe are a public, serious-minded institution, I cannot agree 
with discussions about lesbianism, homosexuality, and transgender taking
 place in the Athenaeum.â The conference was eventually held at a 
different location.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law provide for the freedom of association,
 but the government occasionally restricted freedom of peaceful 
assembly.</p>
<h4>FREEDOM OF PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY</h4>
<p>The constitution provides for freedom of peaceful assembly, and the 
government partially respected it. The law provides that unarmed 
citizens may assemble peacefully but also stipulates that meetings must 
not interfere with other economic or social activities and may not take 
place near such locations as hospitals, airports, or military 
installations. In most cases organizers of public assemblies must 
request permits in writing three days in advance from the mayorâs office
 of the locality where the gathering is to occur.</p>
<p>On October 15, the Supreme Court ruled that public gatherings, 
including protests, must be declared in advance when they are to be held
 in markets, public spaces, or in the vicinity of institutions âof 
public or private interest.â The decision was mandatory. Activists 
opposed these restrictions, stating that by announcing the protests, 
those who take to the streets will be forced to take responsibility not 
only for themselves, but also for larger groups or for instigators to 
violence who may be brought there to compromise peaceful anticorruption 
protests. Civic organizations also warned that in Bucharest, authorities
 granted public spaces for longer periods to NGOs with no activity only 
as a pretext to refuse permits to protest to legitimate organizations.</p>
<p>On August 10, a major protest at Victoria Square in Bucharest 
attracted approximately 100,000 protesters. According to the Ministry of
 Interior, several hundred persons allegedly attempted to get close to 
the cabinet office building and threw objects at gendarmes. Media and 
civic groups reported that the number of violent protesters was much 
lower, amounting to several dozens of persons. Gendarmes used tear gas 
and water cannon in an indiscriminate manner, harming peaceful 
protesters, some of whom were children or elderly. Many bystanders were 
also injured. NGOs, observers, and journalists noted that gendarmes 
launched tear gas canisters in adjacent areas of the square against 
persons who did not pose a threat. Because of the large crowd, 
protesters did not have the opportunity to disperse when gendarmes began
 using tear gas grenades. Gendarmes also used violence against 
protesters who left the protest and were on adjacent streets. Numerous 
broadcast television reports showed members of the gendarmerie punching,
 kicking, and hitting peaceful protesters with their batons. Several 
protesters suffered injuries caused by shrapnel from exploding tear-gas 
canisters.</p>
<p>According to the Interior Ministry, 452 individuals needed medical 
care during the protest, of which 33 were gendarmes; 70 persons were 
taken to the hospital, including 14 gendarmes. Hundreds of protesters 
reported side effects from irritant agents after the protest. Four 
Israeli tourists and a driver who happened to be in the area were 
dragged out of a taxi and beaten by gendarmes. Numerous reports showed 
that several gendarmes had the identification numbers on their helmets 
covered with duct tape. Dozens of civic and human rights NGOs condemned 
the intervention of the gendarmerie, which they viewed as a highly 
disproportionate response to the actions of most protesters.</p>
<h4>FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION</h4>
<p>The constitution provides for freedom of association, and the 
government generally respected this right. The law prohibits fascist, 
racist, or xenophobic ideologies, organizations, and symbols.</p>
<p>In August the government adopted an ordinance that authorizes the 
Ministry of Public Finances to check whether NGOs use the funds 
redirected by citizens from their income tax according to the 
organizationsâ primary goals. The ADHR-HC asserted that this measure 
would allow the government to harass NGOs.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Freedom of Movement, Internally Displaced Persons, Protection of Refugees, and Stateless Persons</h3>

					
					<p>The constitution and law provide for the freedom of internal 
movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the 
government generally respected these rights.</p>
<p>The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in providing 
protection and assistance to refugees, asylum seekers, stateless 
persons, and other persons of concern, which could include irregular 
migrants potentially in need of international protection.</p>
<p><u>Abuse of Migrants, Refugees, and Stateless Persons</u>: According 
to UNHCR, several incidents of harassment and crimes against refugees 
and migrants were reported throughout the year in Bucharest and other 
parts of the country, although many incidents were not reported because 
of fear, lack of information, inadequate support services, and 
inefficient redress mechanisms. Authorities consistently declined to 
investigate incidents of this kind as hate crimes.</p>
<p><u>In-country Movement</u>: The internal movement of beneficiaries of
 international protection and stateless persons was generally not 
restricted. Asylum seekers may be subject to measures limiting their 
freedom of movement and to detention in specific circumstances. The law 
and implementing regulations provide that the General Inspectorate for 
Immigration may designate a specific place of residence for an applicant
 for asylum while authorities determine his or her eligibility or may 
take restrictive measures, subject to approval by the prosecutorâs 
office, that amount to administrative detention in âspecially arranged 
closed areas.â According to UNHCR, as of September no cases of asylum 
detention were recorded during the year. Applicants who do not qualify 
for asylum were treated as aliens without a right to stay in the country
 who may be taken into custody pending deportation. According to the 
law, those applying for asylum while in public custody were released 
from detention if granted access to the ordinary procedure. Detention in
 public custody centers is subject to regular review and should not 
exceed six months unless there are specific circumstances, in which case
 detention may be extended for up to 18 months. Applicants for or 
beneficiaries of international protection in certain circumstances, 
particularly those declared âundesirableâ for reasons of national 
security, may be subject to administrative detention in public custody 
centers.</p>
<p>The government may grant âtolerated statusâ to persons who do not 
meet the requirements for refugee status or subsidiary protection, but 
who cannot be returned for various reasons. These reasons include cases 
where stateless persons are not accepted by their former country of 
habitual residence or where the lives or well-being of returnees could 
be at risk. Persons with âtolerated statusâ have the right to work but 
not to benefit from any other social protection or inclusion provisions,
 and the government restricted their freedom of movement to a specific 
region of the country. According to UNHCR, 244 persons were holders of 
âtolerated statusâ as of January, of whom 141 had been granted 
âtolerationâ as an alternative to detention or following prolonged 
detention.</p>
<h4>PROTECTION OF REFUGEES</h4>
<p><u>Refoulement</u>: The law establishes exceptions to the principle 
of nonrefoulement and the withdrawal of the right to stay following a 
declaration of a person as âundesirable.â This may occur, for example, 
when classified information or âwell founded indicationsâ suggest that 
aliens (including stateless persons), applicants for asylum, or persons 
granted asylum intend to commit terrorist acts or favor terrorism. 
Applicants for protection declared âundesirableâ on national security 
grounds were taken into custody pending the finalization of their asylum
 procedure and then deported. According to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, as of the end of November, 390 persons had been subjected to 
refoulement.</p>
<p><u>Access to Asylum</u>: The law provides access to asylum procedures
 to foreign nationals and stateless persons who express their desire for
 protection, which may be in the form of refugee status or temporary 
âsubsidiary protectionâ status. The asylum law prohibits the expulsion, 
extradition, or forced return of any asylum seeker at the countryâs 
border or from within the countryâs territory, but this was not without 
exception, particularly in cases that fell under the countryâs national 
security and terrorism laws.</p>
<p>UNHCR reported several allegations of denial of access to the 
country, pushbacks, and deviations from asylum procedures at border 
areas.</p>
<p><u>Safe Country of Origin/Transit</u>: The law provides for the 
concept of safe countries of origin. This normally referred to EU member
 states but could also include other countries approved by the Internal 
Affairs Ministry at the recommendation of the General Inspectorate for 
Immigration. Procedurally, the government would normally reject 
applications for asylum by persons who had arrived from a safe country 
under accelerated procedures, except in cases where the factual 
situation or evidence presented by the applicant shows the existence of a
 well-founded fear of persecution. Between January and August, one 
asylum application by an EU national was rejected at the administrative 
level of the asylum procedure; no information regarding the legal basis 
for the rejection was available.</p>
<p>The law also refers to the concept of a safe third country. The law 
extends to irregular migrants who transited and were offered protection 
in a third country considered safe or who had the opportunity at the 
border or on the soil of a safe third country to contact authorities for
 the purpose of obtaining protection. In such cases authorities could 
deny access to asylum procedures if the designated safe third country 
agreed to readmit the applicant to its territory and grant access to 
asylum procedures.</p>
<p><u>Freedom of Movement</u>: The law incorporates four ârestrictiveâ 
measures under which the internal movement of applicants for asylum may 
be limited. The first two establish an obligation to report regularly to
 the General Inspectorate for Immigration or to reside at a regional 
reception center. A third restrictive measure allows authorities to 
place applicants in âspecially arranged closed areasâ for a maximum of 
60 days, either to access the asylum procedure or if the asylum seeker 
is deemed to pose a danger to national security. There was no case of an
 asylum applicant being placed in a specially arranged closed area 
through September. Authorities may also place asylum applicants in 
administrative detention in a public custody center if they are subject 
to a transfer to another EU member state under the Dublin Regulations or
 if they have been declared âundesirableâ for reasons of national 
security, pending their removal from the country.</p>
<p>Under provisions of the law to limit âabuse to the asylum procedure,â
 irregular migrants who submitted their first application for 
international protection while in custody were released from detention 
only if granted access to the ordinary asylum application procedure. The
 provisions raised concerns among UN agencies and civil society due to 
the ambiguity in the phrases âabuse of the asylum procedureâ and ârisk 
of absconding.â</p>
<p>The period of detention in a public custody center could be prolonged up to a maximum of 18 months.</p>
<p><u>Employment</u>: Asylum seekers have the right to work starting 
three months after they submit their first asylum application, if the 
process was not completed. This period begins again if the applicant 
obtains access to a new asylum procedure. Even when granted permission 
to work, many asylum seekers faced problems finding legal work, mainly 
due to the limited validity of their identification documents and lack 
of awareness among potential employers of their right to work.</p>
<p>While persons granted protection have the legal right to work, job 
scarcity, low wages, lack of language proficiency, and lack of 
recognized academic degrees and other certifications often resulted in 
unemployment or employment without a legal contract and its related 
benefits and protections.</p>
<p><u>Access to Basic Services</u>: Effective access by persons with 
refugee status or subsidiary protection to education, housing, lifelong 
learning and employment, public health care, and social security varied 
across the country, depending on the level of awareness of various 
public and private actors responsible for ensuring access to these 
services.</p>
<p>The government provides asylum seekers 16 lei ($4) per day in 
financial assistance, with slightly increased allowances for vulnerable 
persons. The allowance was low relative to the local cost of living, and
 persons with special needs or vulnerabilities were particularly 
affected. Supplementary financial support was provided under 
EU-sponsored projects, but timing gaps between these projects restricted
 funding availability. Applicants for asylum had limited options for 
meaningful activities, such as language classes, cultural orientation, 
and skills training. Romanian language classes were no longer available 
for adults. State-provided social, psychological, and medical assistance
 for asylum applicants remained insufficient, with many dependent on 
NGO-implemented projects for such help. Proper identification and 
assistance for victims of trauma and torture was lacking.</p>
<p><u>Durable Solutions</u>: According to UNHCR, the country had become a
 resettlement country, having agreed to resettle small quotas of 
refugees every year. For 2018-19, the quota pledged by the government 
was 109 Syrian refugees, to be resettled from Turkey (69) and Jordan 
(40) with UNHCR and IOM support. As of September no arrivals had been 
recorded.</p>
<p>UNHCR reported that, as of August, 4,072 persons benefiting from any 
of several forms of legal protection were residing in the country. By 
the end of August, 1,406 persons had submitted new or repeat asylum 
applications.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries of international protection continued to face problems 
with local integration, including access to vocational training adapted 
to their specific needs, counseling programs, and naturalization. 
According to UNHCR, no municipality provided targeted support services 
or targeted integration and inclusion programs to refugees. Access to 
education was problematic, and several school inspectorates refused to 
organize Romanian language classes. According to several reports, 
schools across the country, including in large cities such as Bucharest 
or Timisoara, refused to enroll refugee children in school for several 
months. Obtaining a legal work contract remained difficult for various 
reasons, including tax concerns and the reluctance of employers to hire 
refugees. Recipients of subsidiary protection complained of problems 
regarding their freedom of movement to other countries due to the 
additional visa requirements. UNHCR reported that refugees saw 
citizenship acquisition as a cumbersome, costly, and difficult process, 
with some requirements, particularly related to the applicantâs 
financial situation, that were difficult to meet.</p>
<p><u>Temporary Protection</u>: The government did not grant temporary protection to any individuals during the year.</p>
<h4>STATELESS PERSONS</h4>
<p>According to UNHCR, as of August there were 337 stateless persons 
with valid residence documents in the country. These included legal 
residents under the aliensâ regime, stateless persons of Romanian 
origin, as well as 120 persons granted some form of international 
protection. Data on stateless persons, including on persons at risk of 
statelessness and persons of undetermined nationality, were not reliable
 due to the absence of a procedure to determine statelessness, the 
absence of a single designated authority responsible for this purpose, 
and the lack of adequate identification and registration of persons with
 unknown or undetermined nationality.</p>
<p>The law includes favorable provisions for stateless persons of 
Romanian origin to reacquire citizenship. Nevertheless, a significant 
gap persisted due to the lack of safeguards against statelessness for 
children born in the country, who would be stateless because their 
parents either were themselves stateless or were foreigners unable to 
transmit their nationality.</p>

<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides citizens the ability to choose their government in 
free and mostly fair periodic elections held by secret ballot based on 
universal and equal suffrage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4>Elections and Political Participation</h4>
<p><u>Recent Elections</u>: The country held parliamentary elections in 
2016 that were considered free and fair by international observers. In 
2014 the country held presidential elections in which electoral 
observers noted irregularities, including insufficient polling stations 
for the large diaspora community.</p>
<p><u>Political Parties and Political Participation</u>: The law 
requires political parties to register with the Bucharest Tribunal and 
to submit their statutes, program, and a roster of at least three 
members. Critics asserted that certain requirements undermine the right 
to association. These include the requirement that parties field 
candidatesâby themselves or in allianceâin at least 75 electoral 
constituencies in two successive local elections or that they field a 
full slate of candidates in at least one county or partial slates of 
candidates in a minimum of three counties in two successive 
parliamentary elections. A partyâs statutes and program must not include
 ideas that incite war; discrimination; hatred of a national, racist, or
 religious nature; or territorial separatism.</p>
<p><u>Participation of Women and Minorities</u>: No laws limit 
participation of women or members of minorities in the political 
process, and they did participate. Societal attitudes presented a 
significant barrier, and women remained underrepresented in positions of
 authority. For example, as of September 1, there were 68 women in the 
261-seat Chamber of Deputies and 19 women in the 136-seat Senate.</p>
<p>Under the constitution each recognized ethnic minority is entitled to
 a representative in the Chamber of Deputies. An organization is 
required, however, to receive votes equal to 5 percent of the national 
average number of votes cast by district for a deputy to be elected. The
 list of organizations that benefit from these provisions is limited to 
those that are already part of a National Council of Minorities, which 
consists of organizations already in parliament. The law sets more 
stringent requirements for minority organizations without a presence in 
parliament. To participate in elections, such organizations must provide
 the Central Electoral Bureau a membership list equal to at least 15 
percent of the total number of persons belonging to that ethnic group, 
as determined by the most recent census. If this number amounts to more 
than 20,000 persons, the organization must submit a list with at least 
20,000 names distributed among a minimum of 15 counties plus the city of
 Bucharest, with no fewer than 300 persons from each county. Some 
organizations and individuals, particularly Romani activists, claimed 
this rule was discriminatory.</p>
<p>Ethnic Hungarians, represented by the Democratic Union of Hungarians 
in Romania political party, were the sole ethnic minority to gain 
parliamentary representation by surpassing the 5 percent threshold of 
all valid votes cast nationally, the threshold set for political 
parties. One Romani organization, Roma Party-Pro Europe, had a single 
representative in parliament.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-4" class="report__section-title">Section 4. Corruption and Lack of Transparency in Government</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for corruption by officials,
 but despite numerous high-profile prosecutions, corrupt practices 
remained widespread. There were numerous reports of government 
corruption during the year.</p>
<p>Corruption remained a problem according to World Bank indicators and 
other expert opinion. Bribery was common in the public sector. Laws were
 not always implemented effectively, and officials sometimes engaged in 
corrupt practices with impunity.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: The National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) 
continued to investigate and prosecute corruption cases involving 
political, judicial, and administrative officials throughout the year. 
In April the DNA indicted former finance minister Sebastian Vladescu for
 accepting bribes and trafficking in influence.</p>
<p>Verdicts in corruption cases were often inconsistent, with sentences 
varying widely for similar offenses. Enforcement of court procedures 
lagged mostly due to procedural and administrative problems, especially 
with respect to asset forfeiture.</p>
<p>Corruption was widespread in public procurement. A 2016 law provides 
for a comprehensive software mechanism to flag potential conflicts of 
interest in public procurement, but the law was not implemented. Bribery
 was common in the public sector, especially in health care. Individual 
executive agencies were slow in enforcing sanctions, and agenciesâ own 
inspection bodies were generally inactive. Despite the emphasis on 
prevention in the latest&nbsp;<i>National Anticorruption Strategy</i>, individual agencies and the government did not take significant action in this area.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: The law empowers the National Integrity 
Agency (ANI) to administer and audit financial disclosure statements for
 all public officials and to monitor conflicts of interest. The law 
stipulates that the agency may identify âsignificant discrepanciesâ 
between an officialâs income and assets, defined as more than 45,000 lei
 ($11,250), and allows for seizure and forfeiture of unjustified assets.
 The mechanism for confiscation of âunjustified assetsâ was cumbersome. 
Through October 13, ANI identified five cases of âsignificant 
discrepanciesâ totaling 6.2 million lei ($1.6 million). Through October 
13, ANI identified 139 cases of incompatibilities, 61 cases of conflicts
 of interest, 18 cases of criminal conflict of interest, and two other 
cases with strong indications of criminal or corruption offenses. During
 the year ANI reviewed 4,241 public procurement procedures and issued 
three integrity warnings.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-5" class="report__section-title">Section 5. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A number of domestic and international human rights groups 
generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
generally met with human rights NGOs and were cooperative and sometimes 
responsive to their views. There were some reports that government 
officials were reluctant to cooperate with NGOs that focused on 
institutionalized persons with disabilities or to accept NGO criticism 
of institutions for persons with disabilities. In July 2017 the Ministry
 of Labor and Social Justice ceased to allow representatives of the 
Center for Legal Resources (CLR) to visit institutions for persons with 
disabilities, stating that the ministryâs agreement with CLR would not 
be renewed. CLR is an NGO that reported on alleged abuse of 
institutionalized persons with disabilities.</p>
<p><u>Government Human Rights Bodies</u>: The Office of the Ombudsperson
 has limited power and no authority to protect citizensâ constitutional 
rights in cases requiring judicial action. Although the Office of the 
Ombudsperson is the only institution that may challenge emergency 
ordinances in the Constitutional Court, as of September it failed to 
challenge several controversial ordinances despite persistent calls by 
civil society to do so. The ombudsperson is the national preventive 
mechanism implementing the optional protocol to the UN Convention 
against Torture. This gives the ombudsperson the power to conduct 
monitoring visits to places where individuals are deprived of their 
liberty, including prisons, psychiatric hospitals, and asylum centers. 
As of September the ombudsperson issued 15 reports with recommendations,
 based mainly on visits to penitentiaries and psychiatric facilities. 
Some observers continued to regard the institution as ineffective.</p>
<p>In October 2017 the government established the Office of the 
Childrenâs Ombudsperson empowered to examine human rights complaints 
made by children or their legal representatives. In 2016 parliament 
established the Council for Monitoring the Implementation of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The council was 
authorized to make unannounced visits in centers and hospitals for 
persons with disabilities in order to check if the rights of these 
persons are respected, issue recommendations, and submit criminal 
complaints. As of September the council had issued 12 reports during the
 year with recommendations based on visits to residential centers for 
persons with disabilities. Some observers regarded the institution as 
ineffective and believed that the inspectors who drafted the reports 
lacked the necessary human rights expertise.</p>
<p>Each chamber of parliament has a human rights committee tasked with 
drafting reports on bills pertaining to human rights. On several 
occasions members of these committees expressed the views of their 
political parties rather than addressing problems impartially.</p>
<p>The National Council for Combating Discrimination (CNCD) is the 
government agency responsible for applying domestic and EU 
antidiscrimination laws. The CNCD reports to parliament. The CNCD 
operated with the governmentâs cooperation and, for the most part, 
without government or party interference. According to the CNCD, the 
institution did not receive adequate resources. Observers generally 
regarded the CNCD as effective, but some criticized it for a lack of 
efficiency and political independence.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-6" class="report__section-title">Section 6. Discrimination, Societal Abuses, and Trafficking in Persons</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<h4>Women</h4>
<p><u>Rape and Domestic Violence</u>: Rape, including spousal rape, is 
illegal. The law provides for three to 10 yearsâ imprisonment for rape 
and two to seven yearsâ imprisonment for sexual assault. If there are no
 aggravating circumstances and the attack did not lead to death, police 
and prosecutors may not pursue a case on their own, but they require a 
victimâs complaint, even if there is independent physical evidence.</p>
<p>The criminal code classifies family violence as a separate offense 
and stipulates that when murder, battery, or other serious violence is 
committed against a family member, the penalty is increased. The code 
also states that, if the parties reconcile, criminal liability is 
removed.</p>
<p>Violence against women, including spousal abuse, continued to be a 
serious problem that the government did not effectively address. The law
 provides for the issuance of provisional restraining orders by police 
for a maximum of five days and restraining orders by a court for a 
maximum of six months upon the victimâs request or at the request of a 
prosecutor, the state representative in charge of protecting victims of 
family violence, or, if the victim agrees, a social service provider. 
Violation of a restraining order is punishable by imprisonment for one 
month to one year. The court may also order the abuser to undergo 
psychological counselling. The FILIA Center for Gender Studies and 
Curriculum Developmentâan NGO that aims to promote gender 
equalityâstated that police lacked procedures for the implementation and
 monitoring of restraining orders.</p>
<p>Courts prosecuted very few cases of domestic abuse. Many cases were 
resolved before or during trial when the alleged victims dropped their 
charges or reconciled with the alleged abuser. Anais, an NGO that 
assists victims of domestic violence, reported the case of a victim who,
 since 2013, had obtained 10 restraining orders against her former 
husband. In spite of the restraining order, for the past five years, the
 former husband had been following and abusing her both verbally and 
physically and threatening to kill her. The victim pressed charges on 
multiple occasions for the violation of the restraining order, but the 
Prosecutorâs Office attached to Bucharest Sector 3 Court had not sent 
the case to trial.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Harassment</u>: Criminal law prohibits sexual harassment, 
which it defines as repeatedly asking for sexual favors in a work or 
similar relationship. A victim complaint is necessary to initiate a 
criminal investigation. Penalties range from fines to imprisonment of 
three months to one year. The law on equal opportunities for men and 
women defines sexual harassment as the occurrence of unwanted behavior 
with a sexual connotation, which can be expressed physically, verbally, 
or nonverbally and has the effect or result of damaging a personâs 
dignity and, in particular, the creation of a hostile, intimidating, 
degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. Civil fines range from 
3,000 to 10,000 lei ($750 to $2,500).</p>
<p><u>Coercion in Population Control</u>: There were no reports of coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: Under the law women and men enjoy equal 
rights. Women experienced discrimination in marriage, divorce, child 
custody, employment, credit, pay, owning or managing businesses or 
property, education, the judicial process, and housing. The law requires
 equal pay for equal work, but there was a 4.5 percent gender pay gap 
according to EU data. Segregation by profession existed, with women 
overrepresented in lower-paying jobs. There were reports of 
discrimination in employment.</p>
<h4>Children</h4>
<p><u>Birth Registration</u>: Children derive citizenship by birth from 
at least one citizen parent. Although birth registration is mandatory by
 law, it was not universal, and authorities denied some children public 
services as a result. Most unregistered children had access to schools, 
and authorities assisted in obtaining birth documents for unregistered 
children, but the education of unregistered children depended on the 
decision of school authorities. The law provides simplified birth 
registration for children whose mothers do not have proper documentation
 to register their children.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: Child abuse, including emotional, physical, and 
psychological violence and neglect, continued to be serious problems. 
Media reported several severe cases of abuse or neglect in family homes,
 foster care, and child welfare institutions. The government had not 
established a mechanism to identify and treat abused and neglected 
children and their families.</p>
<p><u>Early and Forced Marriage</u>: The legal age of marriage is 18 for
 both men and women, but the law permits minors as young as 16 to marry 
under certain circumstances. Illegal child marriage was reportedly 
common in certain social groups, particularly among some Romani 
communities. Child protection authorities did not always intervene in 
such cases. There were no public policies to discourage child marriage.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: The law provides one- to 
10-year prison sentences for persons convicted of sexual acts with 
minors, depending on the circumstances and the childâs age. Sexual 
intercourse with a minor who is 13 to 15 years of age is punishable by a
 one- to five-year prison sentence. Sexual intercourse with a person 
under the age of 13 is punishable by a two- to seven-year prison 
sentence and deprivation of some rights. The law also criminalizes 
sexual corruption of minors (which includes subjecting minors to sexual 
acts other than intercourse or forcing minors to perform such acts), 
luring minors for sexual purposes or child prostitution, and trafficking
 in minors. Pimping and pandering that involve minors increase sentences
 by one-half. The Ministry of Labor confirmed that authorities did not 
maintain a registry of individuals who had committed sexual offenses 
against children.</p>
<p>Child pornography is a separate offense and carries a sentence, 
depending on the circumstances, of up to seven yearsâ imprisonment, 
which may be increased by one-third if the perpetrator was a family 
member or someone in whose care the child was trusted or if the life of 
the child victim was endangered.</p>
<p><u>Institutionalized Children</u>: During the year there were several
 media reports of abuses in placement centers for institutionalized 
children, including sexual abuse, physical violence by colleagues or 
staff, and trafficking in persons. Numerous reports noted a lack of 
adequate food, clothing, medical treatment, and counselling services. 
According to an investigation by&nbsp;<i>Newsweek Romania</i>, at least 
362 children from placement centers and schools for persons with special
 needs died between 2013 and 2017, mostly because of accidents, suicide,
 or health problems. The investigation showed that the Authority for the
 Protection of Childrenâs Rights and Adoptions did not centralize data 
on the causes of these deaths. In June media outlets reported that two 
mentally challenged children from a placement center in Peris, Ilfov 
County, were sexually abused by an older child in the center. According 
to a media investigation, the director of the center knew about the 
abuse but did not notify authorities. In 2016 prosecutors indicted 
members of an organized crime network who were recruiting girls from 
orphanages in Iasi for sexual exploitation. In December 2017 the Iasi 
Tribunal convicted the defendants to prison sentences ranging from three
 to seven years for trafficking in minors. The defendants appealed the 
ruling, and as of December the case was pending before the Iasi Court of
 Appeal.</p>
<p>By law unaccompanied migrant children are housed in placement 
centers, where they have access to education and benefits other children
 receive. The detention of families with children is allowed by law, 
with preservation of family unity used as justification. Several such 
cases were recorded during the year.</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is a party to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs&nbsp;<i>Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction</i>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200317161632/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data.html">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data.html</a>.</p>
<h4>Anti-Semitism</h4>
<p>According to the 2011 census, the Jewish population numbered 3,271. Acts of anti-Semitism occurred during the year.</p>
<p>The law prohibits public denial of the Holocaust and fascist, racist,
 anti-Semitic and xenophobic language and symbols, including 
organizations and symbols associated with the indigenous Legionnaire 
interwar fascist movement. The oppression of Roma as well as Jews is 
included in the definition of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Streets, organizations, schools, or libraries continued to be named 
after persons convicted for war crimes or crimes against humanity, 
according to the Elie Wiesel Institute for the Study of the Holocaust in
 Romania. For example, Radu Gyr was a commander and anti-Semitic 
ideologist of the fascist Legionnaire movement convicted of war crimes. 
The Wiesel Institute requested the renaming of Radu Gyr street in 
Cluj-Napoca. As of September the local government had not changed the 
name of the street.</p>
<p>Material promoting anti-Semitic views and glorifying legionnaires 
also appeared in media, including on the internet, while several 
government officials made trivializing comments about the Holocaust. In 
July Agriculture Minister Petre Daea stated on the Antena 3 news channel
 that the incineration of pigs in response to a swine flu outbreak was 
similar to what happened at Auschwitz.</p>
<p>During the night of August 3, anti-Semitic and other offensive 
messages were painted on the childhood home of Auschwitz survivor and 
Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel in Sighetu Marmatiei. The local office of the
 national police started an investigation of the incident and identified
 one suspect.</p>
<p>In April 2017 vandals destroyed 10 tombstones in a Jewish cemetery in
 Bucharest. Police identified three underage persons who were allegedly 
responsible for the crime and stated they had acted without any specific
 reason. As of September the case was pending before the Prosecutorâs 
Office.</p>
<p>In June 2017 the Jewish community in Cluj-Napoca notified police of 
anti-Semitic and Holocaust denial messages painted on the exterior wall 
of the Memorial Temple of Deported Jews synagogue in the city. According
 to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as of September the case was 
pending before the prosecutorâs office attached to the court in 
Cluj-Napoca.</p>
<p>While not explicitly anti-Semitic, verbal attacks during the year 
holding a foreign Jewish philanthropist responsible for domestic 
problems had anti-Semitic connotations. Politicians and the media 
ascribed negative actions to him, such as controlling a ânetwork of 
influencersâ and paying for activities of opposition parties and 
antigovernment protesters.</p>
<p>The government continued to implement the recommendations of the 2004&nbsp;<i>International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania</i>report.
 On October 9, National Holocaust Remembrance Day, the president honored
 several Holocaust survivors and condemned anti-Semitic hatred and 
legislation in the country during the Holocaust, stating they were 
âinconceivable for a society strongly attached to democratic principles 
and the rule of law.â On the same occasion, the prime minister pledged 
that the government would support initiatives âto counter anti-Semitism 
and xenophobia.â The Wiesel Institute continued to organize training 
courses for teachers and other professionals on the history of the 
Holocaust.</p>
<p>The Education Ministry did not include a mandatory class on the 
countryâs Holocaust history as part of the general history curricula in 
force. The high school course&nbsp;<i>History of the JewsâThe Holocaust</i>&nbsp;was optional. During the 2016-17 school year, 2,894 pupils from 75 schools took the course.</p>
<h4>Trafficking in Persons</h4>
<p>See the Department of Stateâs&nbsp;<i>Trafficking in Persons Report</i>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200317161632/http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/">www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/</a>.</p>
<h4>Persons with Disabilities</h4>
<p>The law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, 
sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities. The government did not 
fully implement the law, and discrimination against persons with 
disabilities remained a problem.</p>
<p>The law mandates that buildings and public transportation be 
accessible for persons with disabilities. The country continued to have 
an insufficient number of facilities specifically designed to 
accommodate persons with disabilities who could have extreme difficulty 
navigating city streets or gaining access to public buildings. Persons 
with disabilities reported a lack of access ramps, adapted public 
transportation, and adapted toilets in major buildings.</p>
<p>Discrimination against children with disabilities in education was a 
widespread problem due to lack of adequate teacher training on inclusion
 of children with disabilities and lack of investment to make schools 
accessible. Most children with disabilities were either placed in 
special schools or not placed in school at all. According to the NGO the
 European Center for the Rights of Children with Disabilities (ECRCD), 
abuses against children in special schools, including violence by staff,
 occurred frequently. Several reports by the ECRCD indicated that 
children with disabilities placed in regular schools faced abuse and 
discrimination from classmates and staff.</p>
<p>The Center for Legal Resources identified a series of problems in 
centers for persons with disabilities or psychiatric sections, including
 verbal and physical abuse of children, sedation, excessive use of 
physical restraints, lack of hygiene, inadequate living conditions, and 
lack of adequate medical care.</p>
<p>The National Authority for the Protection of Persons with 
Disabilities, under the labor ministry, coordinated services for persons
 with disabilities and drafted policies, strategies, and standards in 
the field of disabilities rights.</p>
<h4>National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities</h4>
<p>Discrimination against Roma continued to be a major problem. Romani 
groups complained that police harassment and brutality, including 
beatings, were routine. Both domestic and international media and 
observers reported societal discrimination against Roma. NGOs reported 
that Roma were denied access to, or refused service in, many public 
places. Roma also experienced poor access to government services, a 
shortage of employment opportunities, high rates of school attrition, 
and inadequate health care. A lack of identity documents excluded many 
Roma from participating in elections, receiving social benefits, 
accessing health insurance, securing property documents, and 
participating in the labor market. Roma had a higher unemployment rate 
and a lower life expectancy than non-Roma. Negative stereotypes and 
discriminatory language regarding Roma were widespread.</p>
<p>Despite an order by the Ministry of Education forbidding segregation 
of Romani students, several NGOs continued to report that segregation 
along ethnic lines persisted in schools. In 2016 a house, annex, 
outbuildings, and agricultural storage belonging to Roma were burned and
 destroyed in the city of Gheorgheni. Media reported that, prior to the 
arson, police noticed mobs moving towards the area and observed several 
groups shouting anti-Roma statements. Following the incident the 
Gheorgheni mayor blamed Roma for triggering the attack. As of September 
an investigation was pending before the prosecutorâs office attached to 
the Harghita Tribunal.</p>
<p>Researchers and activists reported that a significant number of the 
remaining Romani Holocaust survivors who applied for a pension were 
denied because of unreasonable administrative barriers raised by the 
pension offices, problematic standards, lack of knowledge about the 
Holocaust, and burdensome requirements. According to researchers, 
despite historical evidence, in hundreds of cases authorities considered
 that Roma were resettled and not deported, and consequently granted 
them smaller pensions.</p>
<p>Ethnic Hungarians continued to report discrimination related mainly 
to the use of the Hungarian language. There were continued reports that 
local authorities did not enforce the law, which states that in 
localities where a minority constitutes at least 20 percent of the 
population, road signs must be bilingual. On January 11, Prime Minister 
Mihai Tudose stated on national television that if anyone raised the 
Szekler (Hungarian) flag on a public building, they would âwave beside 
it themselvesâ (a phrase in Romanian that implies hanging). The CNCD 
sanctioned Tudose with a warning. In April, during a soccer match in the
 city of Voluntari between teams from Bucharest and Sfantu Gheorghe, a 
city inhabited mostly by ethnic Hungarians, a song played through the 
loudspeakers included xenophobic expressions that incited violence 
against the Hungarian community. The Romanian Football Federation fined 
the host team 10,000 lei ($2,500).</p>
<p>Several politicians and government officials made derogatory remarks 
about ethnic Germans and equated German ethnicity with National 
Socialism and the Holocaust. On September 2, an advisor to Prime 
Minister Darius Valcov posted a video clip on his Facebook page that 
depicted the German Democrat Forum, an organization of ethnic Germans in
 the country, as a National Socialist organization and compared the 
countryâs president, Klaus Iohannis, to Adolf Hitler. The ethnic German 
and Jewish communities, the Elie Wiesel Institute, several NGOs, and 
opposition political figures condemned Valcovâs behavior, and some of 
them called for his resignation. On August 23, Senator Liviu Pop stated 
during a television program that President Iohannis, a former chair of 
the German Democrat Forum, was the head of a successor group to a Nazi 
organization. After Iohannis condemned the excessive use of force by the
 gendarmerie against protesters on August 10, Labor Minister Lia Olguta 
Vasilescu criticized him with the comment, âCheeky, as a German, to 
speak of attacking [people] with gas.â</p>
<h4>Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h4>
<p>The law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. NGOs 
reported that societal discrimination against LGBTI persons was common, 
and there were some reports of violence against them.</p>
<p>Discrimination in employment occurred against LGBTI persons. On June 
9, a pride parade with more than 5,000 participants took place without 
incident in Bucharest. Before the event approximately 100 persons took 
part in a counterprotest.</p>
<p>On June 5, the European Court of Justice ruled that those EU states 
that do not permit same-sex marriage may nevertheless not obstruct the 
freedom of residence of an EU citizen by refusing to grant his/her 
same-sex spouse, even if he/she is a not an EU national, a derived right
 of residence in their territory. The ruling was issued in the case of 
Romanian citizen and a non-EU foreign citizen who were married in 
Belgium in 2010 and denied the right of permanent residence in Romania.</p>
<p>The law governing legal gender recognition for transgender persons 
was vague and incomplete. In some cases authorities refused legal gender
 recognition unless an individual had first undergone sex reassignment 
surgery. Access to adequate psychological services was also limited 
because some psychologists refused to accept transgender patients.</p>
<h4>HIV and AIDS Social Stigma</h4>
<p>Although the law provides that HIV-infected persons have the right to
 confidentiality and adequate treatment, authorities rarely enforced it.
 Authorities did not adopt regulations that were necessary to provide 
confidentiality and fair treatment, and discrimination against persons 
with HIV/AIDS impeded access to routine medical and dental care.</p>
<h4>Promotion of Acts of Discrimination</h4>
<p>Public figures, politicians, supporters of the Coalition for Family, 
and representatives of several religious denominations made 
discriminatory remarks concerning the LGBTI community. In July 
Vice-President of the Romanian Academy Razvan Theodorescu stated in an 
interview for Evenimentul Zilei newspaper that âall this fuss about 
homosexuals and lesbians is an aberration and we donât need it. These 
are pathological aspects, certain people are sick.â In October, during 
the campaign for the revision of the constitutional definition of 
family, flyers distributed in Bucharest and Craiova by several 
supporters of the referendum referred to alleged cases of children 
sexually and emotionally abused by gay couples. Some members of 
parliament made offending or discriminatory comments about women.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the rights of workers to form and join 
independent labor unions, bargain collectively, and conduct legal 
strikes. Unions can affiliate with regional, national, or EU union 
federations, but may affiliate with only one national organization. The 
law prohibits antiunion discrimination and allows workers fired for 
union activity to challenge in court for reinstatement. The law provides
 for protection of freedom of association and collective bargaining, but
 unions complained there was little enforcement to protect against 
violations of these rights.</p>
<p>Civil servants generally have the right to establish and join unions.
 Employees of the Ministry of National Defense, certain categories of 
civilian employees of the Ministries of Interior and Justice, judges, 
prosecutors, intelligence personnel, and senior public servants, 
including the president, parliamentarians, mayors, prime minister, 
ministers, employees involved in security-related activities, and 
president of the Supreme Court, however, do not have the right to 
unionize. Unions complained about the requirement that they submit lists
 of union members with their registration application. Since employers 
also had access to the list, union officials feared this could lead to 
reprisals against individual unionized employees, particularly 
dismissals, hindering the formation of new unions.</p>
<p>Unions may strike only if they give employers 48 hoursâ notice, and 
employers can challenge the right in court, effectively suspending a 
strike for months. Military personnel and certain categories of staff 
within the Ministry of Internal Affairs, such as medical personnel, are 
not permitted to strike. Although not compulsory, unions and employers 
can seek arbitration and mediation from the Ministry of Laborâs Office 
for Mediation and Arbitration. Companies may claim damages from strike 
organizers if a court deems a strike illegal. The law permits strikes 
only in defense of workersâ economic, social, and professional interests
 and not for the modification or change of a law. As a result, workers 
may not challenge any condition of work established by law, such as 
salaries for public servants, limiting the effectiveness of unions in 
the public sector.</p>
<p>Unions complained that the legal requirement for representativeness, 
which states that the right to collective bargaining and to strike can 
be asserted only by a union that represents 50 percent plus one of the 
workers in an enterprise, is overly burdensome and limits the rights of 
workers to participate in collective bargaining and to strike. In the 
absence of this clear majority, an employer can appoint a worker 
representative of its choosing to negotiate the agreement. Unions also 
complained that some companies created separate legal entities to which 
they transferred employees, thereby preventing them from reaching the 
threshold for representation.</p>
<p>The law requires employers with more than 21 employees to negotiate a
 collective labor agreement but provides no basis for national 
collective labor agreements. Employers refusing to initiate negotiation 
of a collective bargaining agreement can receive fines. The law permits,
 but does not impose, collective labor agreements for groups of 
employers or sectors of activity. The law requires employers to consult 
with unions on such topics as imposing leave without pay or reducing the
 workweek due to economic reasons.</p>
<p>Unions complained that the governmentâs general prohibition on union 
engagement in political activities was intended to prohibit unions from 
entering unofficial agreements to support political parties. The law 
provides for this control due to past abuses by union officials. Unions 
also complained that authorities could exercise excessive control over 
union finances, although the government asserts that national fiscal 
laws apply to all organizations. The International Labor Organizationâs 
Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and 
Recommendations identified fiscal laws as an area of concern.</p>
<p>Union representatives alleged that official reports of incidents of 
antiunion discrimination remained minimal, as it was difficult to prove 
legally that employers laid off employees in retaliation for union 
activities. The CNCD fines employers for antiunion discrimination, 
although it lacked the power to order reinstatement or other penalties. 
In 2017 the CNCD issued fines in 18 cases involving access to employment
 and profession, which includes antiunion discrimination and collective 
bargaining agreement infringement. The law prohibits public authorities,
 employers, or organizations from interfering, limiting, or preventing 
unions from organizing, developing internal regulations, and selecting 
representatives. Possible fines range from 15,000 to 20,000 lei ($3,800 
to $5,000), but in recent years the Labor Inspectorate, which also has 
jurisdiction over discrimination claims, had not applied such sanctions.
 The potential fines were insufficient to deter violations, and 
employees must usually seek judicial remedies to order reinstatement.</p>
<p>The government and employers generally respected the right of 
association and collective bargaining, and union officials stated that 
registration requirements stipulated by law were complicated but 
generally reasonable.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor. 
Nevertheless, there were reports that such practices continued to occur,
 often involving Roma, disabled persons, and children. The government 
did not effectively enforce the law and took limited measures to prevent
 forced or compulsory labor. The law criminalizes forced labor with 
penalties ranging from one to three yearsâ imprisonment, exploitation 
for beggary with penalties ranging from six monthsâ to five yearsâ 
imprisonment, and enslavement with penalties of imprisonment for three 
to 10 years. These penalties were insufficient to deter violations.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 79 of the 662 victims 
of trafficking officially identified in 2017 were exploited specifically
 for labor purposes. Of these, 42 were trafficked for agricultural work.
 Appeals courts in Arges County affirmed the convictions of seven 
defendants sentenced to between four and eight years in prison for their
 roles in a forced labor case in Berevoiesti. In 2016 the Directorate 
for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) uncovered a 
human trafficking ring that had forced its kidnapped victims, including 
children, into beggary, slavery, and other forms of forced labor. The 
captors allegedly kept the victims locked and chained, beat them, and 
forced them to work.</p>
<p>In October 2017 DIICOT uncovered a group of three citizens who had 
exploited minors and vulnerable adults for work at a mountain sheep hold
 on three separate occasions. The victims suffered abuse and assault and
 had their cell phones taken away. One victim escaped by walking nearly 
18 miles back to his hometown.</p>
<p>Men, women, and children were subjected to labor trafficking in 
agriculture, construction, domestic service, hotels, and manufacturing. 
Organized rings, often involving family members, forced persons, 
including significant numbers of Romani women and children, to engage in
 begging and petty theft (see section 7.c.).</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits the worst forms of child labor. The minimum 
age for most forms of employment is 16. Children may work with the 
consent of parents or guardians at age 15 if the activities do not 
endanger their health, morality, or safety. The law prohibits persons 
younger than age 18 from working in hazardous conditions, includes a 
list of dangerous jobs, and specifies penalties for offenders. Some 
examples of hazardous jobs for children include those posing a high risk
 of accident or damage to health, exposure to psychological or sexual 
risk, night shifts, exposure to harmful temperatures, and those 
requiring use of hazardous equipment. Parents whose children carry out 
hazardous activities are required to attend parental education programs 
or counseling and may be fined between 100 and 1,000 lei ($25 and $250) 
if they fail to do so. Persons or companies who employ children for 
hazardous tasks may be fined 500 to 1,500 lei ($125 to $375).</p>
<p>Minors who work have the right to continue their education, and the 
law obliges employers to assist in this regard. Minors between the ages 
of 15 and 18 may work a maximum of six hours per day and no more than 30
 hours per week, provided their school attendance is not affected. 
Businesses that impose tasks incommensurate with minorsâ physical 
abilities or fail to respect restrictions on minorsâ working hours can 
face fines of up to 6,000 lei ($1,500). Many minors reportedly did not 
attend school while working. Minors have the right to an additional 
three days of annual leave.</p>
<p>The law requires schools to notify social services immediately if 
children miss class to work, but schools often did not comply. Social 
welfare services have the responsibility to reintegrate such children 
into the educational system.</p>
<p>Penalties for violation of child labor laws include sentences ranging
 from one to two yearsâ imprisonment or fines. Violations were rarely 
prosecuted, and penalties were not sufficient to deter violations. The 
Ministry of Labor may impose fines and close businesses where it finds 
exploitation of child labor. The National Authority for the Protection 
of the Rights of the Child and Adoption (ANPFDC) in the Labor Ministry 
has responsibility for investigating reports of child labor abuse, but 
enforcement of child labor laws tended to be lax, especially in rural 
areas with many agricultural households and where social welfare 
services lacked personnel and capacity to address child labor 
violations.</p>
<p>The ANPFDC is responsible for monitoring and coordinating all 
programs for the prevention and elimination of child labor. Government 
efforts focused on reacting to reported cases, and the ANPFDC dedicated 
limited resources to prevention programs. According to the ANPFDC, 356 
children were subject to child labor in 2017. The incidence of child 
labor was widely believed to be much higher than official statistics 
reflected. Child labor, including begging, selling trinkets on the 
street, and washing windshields, remained widespread in Romani 
communities, especially in urban areas. Children as young as five 
engaged in such activities, and cases were usually documented only when 
police became involved. Of the 356 documented cases of child labor in 
2017, authorities prosecuted only 14 alleged perpetrators.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>Labor laws and regulations prohibit discrimination with respect 
to employment and occupation because of race, sex, gender, age, 
religion, disability, language, sexual orientation or gender identity, 
HIV-positive or other communicable disease status, social status, or 
refugee or stateless status. The government did not enforce these laws 
effectively, reacting to claims of discrimination rather than adequately
 engaging in programs to prevent discrimination. Although the CNCD and 
the Labor Inspectorate investigated reported cases of discrimination, 
penalties were insufficient to deter violations. The penalties for 
discrimination include fines of between 1,000 and 30,000 lei ($250 and 
$7,500) for discrimination against an individual, or between 2,000 and 
100,000 lei ($500 and $25,000) for discrimination targeting a group of 
individuals or a community.</p>
<p>Discrimination in employment or occupation occurred with respect to 
gender, disability, and HIV status. Discrimination against Roma and 
migrant workers also occurred. In 2017 the CNCD processed 273 
discrimination cases with respect to employment. The CNCD addressed 
cases in both the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>According to Eurostat, the pay gap between men and women in the 
country was 5.2 percent in 2016. While the law provides female employees
 re-entering the workforce after maternity leave the right to return to 
their previous or a similar job, pregnant women and other women of 
childbearing age could still suffer unacknowledged discrimination in the
 labor market.</p>
<p>Although systematic discrimination against persons with disabilities 
did not exist, the public at large had a bias against those with 
disabilities. NGOs worked actively to change attitudes and assist 
persons with disabilities to gain skills and employment, but the 
government lacked adequate programs to prevent discrimination. A 
government ordinance that took effect in September 2017 includes a 
provision requiring companies or institutions with more than 50 
employees to employ workers with disabilities for at least 4 percent of 
their workforce or pay a fine for lack of compliance. Before the 
ordinance was adopted, the law allowed companies not in compliance with 
the quota to fulfill their legal obligation by buying products from NGOs
 or firms, known as âsheltered units,â where large numbers of disabled 
persons were employed. NGOs reported that sheltered units lost an 
important source of income as a result.</p>
<p>In 2016 the LGBTI rights group ACCEPT received reports of eight cases
 of employment discrimination against LGBTI persons and guided the 
complainants in possible courses of action. One case was resolved after 
the complainant filed an internal complaint with the employer in June; 
three other individuals refused to appeal to the CNCD or the courts due 
to concerns about further harassment, preferring settlements with their 
employers.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for a national minimum wage that is greater 
than the official estimate for the poverty income level. The minimum 
wage more than doubled in nominal terms since 2012, rising from 700 lei 
($186) to 1,900 lei ($505) during the year. Authorities enforced wage 
laws adequately, although a significant informal economy existed. 
According to Eurostat data, in 2017 more than a third of the population 
(35.7 percent) was at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Despite 
minimum wage increases, nearly one in five employed Romanians (18.9 
percent) was at risk of poverty.</p>
<p>The law provides for a standard workweek of 40 hours or five days. 
Workers are entitled to overtime pay for weekend or holiday work or work
 of more than 40 hours. An employeeâs workweek may not exceed 48 hours 
per week on average over a four-month reference period, although certain
 exceptions are allowed for certain sectors or professions. The law 
requires a 48-hour rest period in the workweek, although most workers 
received two days off per week. During reductions in workplace activity 
for economic or technical reasons, the law allows employers to shorten 
an employeeâs workweek and reduce the associated salary. Excessive 
overtime may lead to fines for employers if workers file a complaint, 
but complaints were rare. The law prohibits compulsory overtime.</p>
<p>The law gives employers wide discretion regarding the 
performance-based evaluation of employees. The law permits 90-day 
probationary periods for new employees and simplifies termination 
procedures during this period.</p>
<p>The law provides for temporary and seasonal work and sets penalties 
for work performed without a labor contract in either the formal or the 
informal economy. The fine for employers using undeclared workers is 
20,000 lei ($5,000) for each individual working without a labor 
contract, up to a maximum of 200,000 lei ($50,000). The maximum duration
 of a temporary contract 36 months, in accordance with EU regulations.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor, through the Labor Inspectorate, is responsible
 for enforcing the law on working conditions, health and safety, and 
minimum wage rates. The inspectorate was understaffed and inspectors 
underpaid; consequently, the inspectorate had high turnover and limited 
capacity. Minimum wage, hours of work, and occupational safety and 
health standards were not effectively enforced in all sectors. The 
construction, agriculture, and small manufacturers sectors were 
particularly problematic sectors for both labor underreporting and 
neglecting health and safety standards. The Labor Inspectorate 
identified 5,609 undeclared workers in 2017 and fined employers 45.7 
million lei ($11.5 million). Through June the Labor Inspectorate 
identified 4,940 undeclared workers and fined employers 64.6 million lei
 ($16.2 million).</p>
<p>According to trade union reports, many employers paid supplemental 
salaries under the table to reduce both employeesâ and employersâ tax 
burdens. To address underreported labor, in 2017 the government 
increased the minimum required payroll taxes that employers must pay for
 their part-time employees to equal those of a full-time employee 
earning minimum wage. In addition the Labor Inspectorate collaborated 
with the National Authority for Fiscal Administration to conduct joint 
operations to check employers in sectors prone to underreported labor, 
including the textile, construction, security, cleaning, food 
preparation, transportation, and storage industries. These 
investigations often focused on underpayment of taxes rather than 
workersâ rights.</p>
<p>The government did not effectively enforce overtime standards. Union 
leaders complained that overtime violations were the main problem facing
 their members, since employers often required employees to work longer 
than the legal maximum without always receiving mandatory overtime 
compensation. This practice was especially prevalent in the textile, 
banking and finance, and construction sectors. In August employees in a 
wiring and cable factory in Arges County complained about work 
conditions and practices, including insufficient breaks and mistreatment
 by management. Penalties for violating overtime standards ranged from 
5,000 lei ($1,250) to 10,000 lei ($2,500). Fines of 20,000 lei ($5,000) 
were imposed for not respecting provisions regarding special 
compensation or leave for national holidays.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor is responsible for establishing occupational 
health and safety standards, and the Labor Inspectorate inspects 
employers for compliance with regulations. The high number of violations
 suggested that the penalties did not deter abuses. In 2017 inspectors 
focusing on workplace safety conducted 56,629 inspections, imposed 
76,154 fines, and applied sanctions ranging from remedial 
recommendations to workplace or equipment suspension. Workers could 
remove themselves from situations they deemed dangerous to their health 
or safety without jeopardy to their employment. Not all workplace 
accidents are investigated by labor inspectors. Companies investigated 
minor incidents, while labor inspectors investigated more severe ones, 
typically those that resulted in fatalities or in multiple injuries. If 
appropriate, incidents may be referred for criminal investigation. Union
 leaders stated that labor inspectors only superficially investigated 
workplace accidents, including ones involving fatalities, and inspectors
 often wrongly concluded that the victims were at fault in most fatal 
accidents.</p>
