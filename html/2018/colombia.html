				<p>Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty republic. In June voters
 elected Ivan Duque Marquez president in elections that observers 
considered free and fair and the most peaceful in decades.</p>
<p>Civilian authorities generally maintained effective control over security forces.</p>
<p>Human rights issues included reports of unlawful or arbitrary 
killings; reports of torture and arbitrary detention by both government 
security forces and illegal armed groups; corruption; rape and abuse of 
women and children by illegal armed groups; criminalization of libel; 
violence and threats of violence against human rights defenders and 
social leaders; violence against and forced displacement of 
Afro-Colombian and indigenous persons; violence against lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons; forced child labor; and 
killings and other violence against trade unionists.</p>
<p>The government took steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish 
officials who committed human rights abuses, although some cases 
experienced long delays that raised concerns about accountability. The 
Special Jurisdiction for Peace (SJP, or JEP in Spanish)âthe justice 
component of the Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation, 
and Non-Repetitionâstarted operations during the year.</p>
<p>As part of the 2016 peace accord, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC), formerly the countryâs largest guerrilla insurgency 
group, disarmed and reincorporated as a political party that 
participated in the March congressional elections and initially 
nominated a presidential candidate, who withdrew from the race in May. 
On July 20, FARC representatives took up eight of their guaranteed 10 
seats in congress.</p>
<p>The National Liberation Army (ELN) perpetrated armed attacks across 
the country for much of the year, particularly following the conclusion 
of a brief bilateral cease-fire, which lasted from October 1, 2017, 
through January 9. Peace talks between the ELN and Santos government 
concluded without resolution in August, and the Duque administration 
suspended talks until the ELN agrees to new preconditions for 
negotiations. Other illegal armed groups and drug-trafficking gangs 
continued to operate. Illegal armed groups, as well as narcotics 
traffickers, were significant perpetrators of human rights abuses and 
violent crimes and committed acts of extrajudicial and unlawful 
killings, extortion, and other abuses such as kidnapping, torture, human
 trafficking, bombings and use of landmines, restriction on freedom of 
movement, sexual violence, recruitment and use of child soldiers, and 
intimidation of journalists, women, and human rights defenders.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings</h3>

					
					<p>There were reports that the government or its agents committed 
arbitrary or unlawful killings. According to the nongovernmental 
organization (NGO) Colombia Europe United States Coordination (<i>Coordinacion Colombia Europa Estados Unidos</i>,
 CCEEU), from January 1 through August, there were 27 cases of 
âintentional deaths of civilians committed by state agentsâ that 
included 34 victims.</p>
<p>For example, the Attorney Generalâs Office reported October 23 that 
eight members of the 29th Army Land Battalion attached to the Armyâs 
Third Buffalo Company had been arrested and were under investigation for
 alleged crimes of aggravated homicide and attempted aggravated homicide
 in relation to the March killing of a peasant named Ciro Alfonso 
Manzano Ariza and attempted killing of Andres Fabian Salcedo Rincon in 
Arauca. An investigation by the Attorney Generalâs Office Special 
Investigations Unit, in conjunction with the army, revealed the killing 
was unrelated to a supposed confrontation. In a press release, the 
Attorney Generalâs Office stated its commitment to investigate and 
prosecute crimes of this type âso that these forms of violence do not 
continue to present themselves.â</p>
<p>Illegal armed groups including the ELN committed numerous unlawful or
 politically motivated killings, often in areas without a strong 
government presence (see section 1.g.).</p>
<p>Investigations of past killings proceeded, albeit slowly. From 
January 1 through July, the Attorney Generalâs Office registered one new
 case of alleged aggravated homicide by state agents. During the same 
period, authorities formally accused 123 members of the security forces 
of aggravated homicide or homicide of a civilian, almost all for crimes 
that occurred prior to 2017, and made one arrest. The Attorney Generalâs
 Office reported that through August, it obtained six new convictions of
 security force members in cases involving homicide of a âprotected 
personâ (i.e., civilians and others accorded such status under 
international humanitarian law), four new convictions in cases involving
 aggravated homicide, and 14 new convictions in cases involving âsimple 
homicideâ committed by security force members. Of these sentences, 23 
corresponded to cases that took place before 2018.</p>
<p>For instance, on August 14, Jose Miguel Narvaez, deputy director of 
the disbanded Administrative Department of Security, was sentenced to 30
 years in prison for the 1999 killing of journalist Jaime Garzon.</p>
<p>There were developments in efforts to hold officials accountable in 
false positive extrajudicial killings, in which thousands of civilians 
were killed and falsely presented as guerrilla combatants in the late 
1990s to late 2000s. During 2017 and through May 20, the Attorney 
Generalâs Office reported 246 members of the security forces were 
convicted in cases related to âfalse positives,â 716 cases were in the 
prosecution phase, and 10 new investigations were opened. In total, the 
government had convicted 1,176 members of the security forces in cases 
related to false positives as of May, including at least eight colonels,
 according to the Attorney Generalâs Office.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office reported there were open investigations
 of 19 retired and active-duty generals related to false positive 
killings as of May. The Attorney Generalâs Office also reported there 
were 2,504 open investigations related to false positive killings or 
other extrajudicial killings as of May 20.</p>
<p>Additionally, the JEP reviewed some investigations related to false 
positive or extrajudicial killings. For example, on July 10, the JEP 
began to review the case against retired general William Henry Torres 
Escalante. Retired general Mario Montoya Uribe also chose to bring his 
pending case to the JEP. On August 10, after the JEP received his case, 
Colonel Gabriel Rincon publicly apologized for his involvement in false 
positive killings in 2008 in Soacha. More than 1,900 members of the 
armed forces signed a commitment to participate in the JEPâs processes.</p>
<p>In January media reports indicated the Attorney Generalâs Office 
intended to file charges of aggravated homicide against two members of 
the security forces in relation to the October 2017 events in the 
southwestern municipality of Tumaco, Narino Department, that the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) reported resulted in 
the killing of at least seven persons, including two members of the Awa 
indigenous people and the wounding of 20 others.</p>
<p>Illegal armed groups, including the ELN and narcotics traffickers, 
were significant perpetrators of violent crimes and committed unlawful 
killings (see section 1.g.).</p>
<p>Human rights organizations, victims, and government investigators 
accused some members of government security forces of collaborating with
 or tolerating the activities of organized-crime gangs, which included 
some former paramilitary members. According to the Attorney Generalâs 
Office, between January and August 10, 83 members of government security
 forces were arrested for ties with illegal armed groups.</p>
<p>According to a December 26 UN report, the UN Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reported 163 verified killings of 
social leaders and human rights defenders since the signing of the peace
 accord in November 2016 and a total of 454 cases reported. According to
 the Attorney Generalâs Office, 28 persons in 19 cases have been 
convicted in the killings of human rights defenders and social leaders. 
According to the Centro Nacional de Consultoria and the NGO Consultancy 
for Human Rights and Displacement, 70 percent of the killings occurred 
in eight of the countryâs 32 departments: Antioquia, Cauca, Valle del 
Cauca, Narino, Norte de Santander, Choco, Cordoba, and Putumayo. The 
motives of the killings varied, and it was often difficult to determine 
the primary or precise motive in individual cases.</p>
<p>For example, on January 27, Temistocles Machado, a prominent human 
rights activist and Afro-Colombian community leader, was killed in 
Buenaventura in Valle Del Cauca. Former president Juan Manuel Santos 
requested the Elite Corps of the National Police to prioritize the 
investigation of the case, and authorities instituted proceedings 
against five persons as of yearâs end.</p>
<p>On November 19, President Duque created the Commission of the Timely 
Action Plan for Prevention and Protection for Human Rights Defenders, 
Social and Communal Leaders, and Journalists (<i>Comision del Plan de Accion Oportuna para Defensores de Derechos Humanos, Lideres Sociales, Comunales y Periodistas</i>,
 PAO) to strengthen coordination including efforts to investigate and 
prevent attacks against social leaders and human rights defenders. 
Additionally, the minister of interior reported to the UN Human Rights 
Council in May that the government established an elite corps of the 
National Police, a specialized subdirectorate of the National Protection
 Unit, a special investigation unit of the Attorney Generalâs Office 
responsible for dismantling criminal organizations and enterprises, and a
 unified command post, which the minister stated shared responsibility 
for protecting human rights defenders from attack and investigating and 
prosecuting these cases.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Disappearance</h3>

					
					<p>There were no reports of disappearances by or on behalf of 
government authorities during the year. According to the National 
Institute of Forensic and Legal Medicine, from January 1 through August 
30, 3,643 cases of disappearances were registered. During 2017 the 
National Institute of Forensic and Legal Medicine reported 6,670 cases 
of disappearances. The government did not provide information on the 
number of victims of disappearances who were located or a disaggregation
 of the number found alive or dead.</p>
<p>For example, on October 3, unknown organized criminal groups abducted
 Cristo Jose Contreras, a five-year-old boy, in the municipality of El 
Carmen. After a large search and rescue operation, the boy was released 
one week later. In the context of the peace process, the government took
 steps to establish a new search commission to investigate 
disappearances (see section 1.g.).</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h3>

					
					<p>Although the law prohibits such practices, there were reports 
that government officials employed them. The NGO Center for Research and
 Education of the Populace (CINEP) reported that through October, 
security forces were allegedly involved in six cases of torture. Members
 of the military and police accused of torture generally were tried in 
civilian rather than military courts.</p>
<p>For example, media reported Colombian National Police officers in 
Bogota allegedly forced several youth to strip to their underwear and 
beat them with a blunt object, while verbally abusing them in an 
incident caught on video that later became public. Authorities stated 
the incident occurred on September 28 after an escape attempt at the El 
Redentor Detention Center in which a scuffle led to the injuries of two 
police officers. Media reported that authorities had initiated criminal 
and disciplinary investigations into the case, which a prosecutor said 
met the legal definition of torture.</p>
<p>Between January 1 and August 10, the Attorney Generalâs Office 
charged 64 members of the military and police force with torture; in 
each case the alleged torture occurred prior to 2018.</p>
<p>CINEP reported organized-crime gangs and illegal armed groups were 
responsible for six documented cases of torture through June 30. Three 
of those cases were allegedly committed by FARC dissidents not 
participating in the peace process.</p>
<p>According to NGOs monitoring prison conditions, there were numerous 
allegations of sexual and physical violence committed by guards and 
other inmates.</p>
<h4>Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h4>
<p>With the exception of some new facilities, prisons and detention 
centers were harsh and life threatening due to overcrowding, inadequate 
sanitation, poor health care, and lack of other basic services. Poor 
training of officials remained a problem throughout the prison system.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: The National Prison Institute (INPEC), 
which operated the national prisons and oversaw the jails, estimated in 
2017 there were 119,126 persons incarcerated in 135 prisons. A total of 
69,276 persons were in pretrial detention. Overcrowding existed in menâs
 and in womenâs prisons. INPEC cited several prisons in Cali, Santa 
Marta, Valledupar, Itagui, and Apartado that were more than 200 percent 
overcrowded. According to the Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar
 (ICBF), from 2006 until November, more than 234,000 minors had entered 
the criminal justice system through the Criminal Responsibility System 
for Adolescents. Between January and July, 64 children younger than age 
three were reported to be in prison with their incarcerated mothers.</p>
<p>The law prohibits holding pretrial detainees with convicted 
prisoners, although this sometimes occurred. Juvenile detainees are held
 in a separate juvenile detention center. The Superior Judiciary Council
 stated the maximum time that a person may remain in judicial detention 
facilities is three days. The same rules apply to jails located inside 
police stations. These regulations were often violated.</p>
<p>The practice of preventive detention, in combination with 
inefficiencies in the judicial system, continued to exacerbate 
overcrowding. The government continued to implement procedures 
introduced in 2017 that provide for the immediate release of some 
pretrial detainees, including many accused of serious crimes such as 
aggravated robbery and sexual assault.</p>
<p>Physical abuse by prison guards, prisoner-on-prisoner violence, and 
authoritiesâ failure to maintain control were problems. The Inspector 
Generalâs Office continued to investigate allegations that some prison 
guards routinely used excessive force and treated inmates brutally. The 
Inspector Generalâs Office reported 139 disciplinary investigations 
against prison guards, including 126 for physical abuse and 13 for 
sexual crimes.</p>
<p>During the year there were 501 deaths in prisons, jails, pretrial 
detention, or other detention centers, including 476 attributed to 
natural causes, 10 attributed to suicide, 10 in which the cause was 
unknown, and five attributed to accidental causes.</p>
<p>Many prisoners continued to face difficulties receiving adequate 
medical care. Nutrition and water quality were deficient and contributed
 to the overall poor health of many inmates. Inmates stated authorities 
routinely rationed water in many facilities, which officials attributed 
to city water shortages.</p>
<p>INPECâs physical structures were generally in poor repair. The 
Inspector Generalâs Office noted some facilities had poor ventilation 
and overtaxed sanitary systems. Prisoners in some high-altitude 
facilities complained of inadequate blankets and clothing, while 
prisoners in tropical facilities complained that overcrowding and 
insufficient ventilation contributed to high temperatures in prison 
cells. Some prisoners slept on floors without mattresses, while others 
shared cots in overcrowded cells.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: Authorities investigated credible prisoner 
complaints of mistreatment and inhuman conditions, including complaints 
of prison guards soliciting bribes from inmates, but some prisoners 
asserted the investigations were slow.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: The government permitted independent 
monitoring of prison conditions by local and international human rights 
groups. INPEC required a three-day notice before granting consular 
access. Some NGOs complained that authorities, without adequate 
explanation, denied them access to visit prisoners.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention and provides 
for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness of his or her 
arrest or detention; however, there were allegations that authorities 
detained citizens arbitrarily. CINEP reported 13 cases of arbitrary 
detention committed by state security forces through June 30.</p>
<h4>ROLE OF THE POLICE AND SECURITY APPARATUS</h4>
<p>The Colombian National Police (CNP) is responsible for internal law 
enforcement and is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense. 
The Migration Directorate, part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is 
the immigration authority. The CNP shares law enforcement investigatory 
duties with the Technical Investigation Body. In addition to its 
responsibility to defend the country against external threats, the army 
shares limited responsibility for law enforcement and maintenance of 
order within the country. For example, military units sometimes provided
 logistical support and security for criminal investigators to collect 
evidence in high-conflict or remote areas. The government continued to 
expand education and training of the armed forces in human rights and 
international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>Some NGOs complained that military investigators, not members of the 
Attorney Generalâs Office, were sometimes the first responders in cases 
of deaths resulting from actions of security forces and might make 
decisions about possible foul play. By law the Attorney Generalâs Office
 is the main entity responsible for investigating allegations of human 
rights abuses committed by security forces. The government made 
improvements in investigating and trying abuses, but claims of impunity 
for security force members continued. This was due in some cases to 
obstruction of justice and opacity in the process by which cases are 
investigated and prosecuted in the military justice system. Inadequate 
protection of witnesses and investigators, delay tactics by defense 
attorneys, the judiciaryâs failure to exert appropriate controls over 
dockets and case progress, and inadequate coordination among government 
entities that sometimes allowed statutes of limitations to 
expireâresulting in a defendantâs release from jail before trialâwere 
also significant obstacles.</p>
<p>The military functions under both the old inquisitorial and a newer 
accusatory system. The military had not trained its criminal justice 
actors to operate under the accusatory system, which they were to begin 
to implement in 2017. The military also had not developed an 
interinstitutional strategy for recruiting, hiring, or training 
investigators, crime scene technicians, or forensic specialists, which 
is required under the accusatory system. As such, the military justice 
system did not exercise criminal investigative authority; all new 
criminal investigations duties were conducted by judicial police 
investigators from the CNP and Corps of Technical Investigators.</p>
<h4>ARREST PROCEDURES AND TREATMENT OF DETAINEES</h4>
<p>Authorities must bring detained persons before a judge within 36 
hours to determine the validity of the detention, bring formal charges 
within 30 days, and start a trial within 90 days of the initial 
detention. Public defenders contracted by the Office of the Ombudsman 
assisted indigent defendants. Detainees received prompt access to legal 
counsel and family members as provided for by law. Authorities generally
 respected these rights.</p>
<p><u>Arbitrary Arrest</u>: The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and 
detention; however, this requirement was not always respected. NGOs 
characterized some arrests as arbitrary detention: arrests allegedly 
based on tips from informants about persons linked to guerrilla 
activities, detentions by members of the security forces without a 
judicial order, detentions based on administrative authority, detentions
 during military operations or at roadblocks, large-scale detentions, 
and detentions of persons while they were âexercising their fundamental 
rights.â</p>
<p><u>Pretrial Detention</u>: The judicial process moved slowly, and the
 civilian judicial system suffered from a significant backlog of cases, 
which led to large numbers of pretrial detainees. The failure of many 
local military commanders and jail supervisors to keep mandatory 
detention records or follow notification procedures made accounting for 
all detainees difficult. INPEC estimated that 33 percent of the 
countryâs prison inmates were held in pretrial detention. In some cases 
detainees were released without a trial because they had already served 
more than one-third of the maximum sentence for their charges.</p>
<p>Civil society groups complained that authorities subjected some community leaders to extended pretrial detention.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for an independent judiciary, and the 
government generally respected judicial independence and impartiality. 
Much of the judicial system was overburdened and inefficient, however, 
and subornation, corruption, and intimidation of judges, prosecutors, 
and witnesses hindered judicial functioning.</p>
<h4>TRIAL PROCEDURES</h4>
<p>The constitution and law provide for the right to a fair and public 
trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. While
 the government began implementing an accusatory system of justice in 
2008, the use of delay tactics by defense lawyers to slow or impede 
proceedings, prosecutorsâ heavy caseloads, and other factors diminished 
the anticipated increased efficiencies and other benefits of adopting 
the adversarial model. Under the criminal procedure code, the prosecutor
 presents an accusation and evidence before an impartial judge at an 
oral, public trial. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty
 beyond a reasonable doubt and have the right to confront the trial 
evidence and witnesses against them, present their own evidence, and 
communicate with an attorney of their choice (or have one provided at 
public expense). Defendants have adequate time and facilities to prepare
 their defense. Defendants are not compelled to testify or confess guilt
 and have the right to appeal their proceedings. Although defendants 
have the right to an interpreter, the court system lacked interpreters 
for less commonly encountered languages. Crimes committed before 2008 
are processed under the prior written inquisitorial system in which the 
prosecutor is a magistrate who investigates, determines evidence, and 
makes a finding of guilt or innocence. In those cases the trial consists
 of the presentation of evidence and finding of guilt or innocence to a 
judge for ratification or rejection.</p>
<p>In the military justice system, military judges preside over 
courts-martial. Counsel may represent the accused and call witnesses, 
but most fact finding takes place during the investigative stage. 
Military trial judges issue rulings within eight days of a court-martial
 hearing. Representatives of the civilian Inspector Generalâs Office are
 required to be present at courts-martial.</p>
<p>Criminal procedure within the military justice system includes 
elements of the inquisitorial and accusatory systems. The law provides 
for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally 
enforced this right. Defendants are considered innocent until proven 
guilty and have the right to timely consultation with counsel.</p>
<h4>POLITICAL PRISONERS AND DETAINEES</h4>
<p>The government declared that it did not hold political prisoners; 
nevertheless, authorities held some members of human rights advocacy 
groups on charges of conspiracy, rebellion, or terrorism, which the 
groups described as government harassment against human rights 
advocates. According to INPEC, the government held 776 persons on 
charges of rebellion or of aiding and promoting insurgency. The 
government provided the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 
regular access to these prisoners.</p>
<h4>CIVIL JUDICIAL PROCEDURES AND REMEDIES</h4>
<p>Citizens may sue a government agent or entity in the Administrative 
Court of Litigation for damages resulting from a human rights violation.
 Although critics complained of delays in the process, the court 
generally was considered impartial and effective. Cases involving 
violations of an individualâs human rights may be submitted through 
petitions by individuals or organizations to the IACHR, which in turn 
may submit the case to the Inter-American Court on Human Rights. The 
court may order civil remedies, including fair compensation to the 
individual injured.</p>
<h4>PROPERTY RESTITUTION</h4>
<p>The 2011 Victimsâ and Land Restitution Law (Victimsâ Law) continued 
to provide a legal basis for assistance and reparations to persons, 
including victims of government abuses, but the government admitted that
 the pace of restitution was slow. The government did not provide 
information on the number of those registered who received some form of 
assistance. The Land Restitution Unit, a semiautonomous entity in the 
Ministry of Agriculture, is responsible for returning land to displaced 
victims of conflict.</p>
<p>The Land Restitution Unit reported it had reviewed 276 requests for 
collective restitution of ethnic territories, covering an area of 17.1 
million acres, including 99,754 families, and 114,768 individual 
restitution claims, of which 15,899 were awaiting final judicial 
decision. The claims encompassed more than 12 million acres benefitting 
52,017 families.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-6" class="report__section-subtitle">f. Arbitrary or Unlawful Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits such actions, but there were allegations the 
government failed to respect these prohibitions. Government authorities 
generally need a judicial order to intercept mail or email or to monitor
 telephone conversations, including in prisons. Government intelligence 
agencies investigating terrorist organizations sometimes monitored 
telephone conversations without judicial authorization; the law bars 
evidence obtained this way from being used in court.</p>
<p>NGOs continued to accuse domestic intelligence or security entities 
of spying on lawyers and human rights defenders, threatening them, and 
breaking into their homes or offices to steal information.</p>
<p>On August 4, the Attorney Generalâs Office arrested government 
agents, including three retired army officers, for illegal monitoring 
activities.&nbsp;<i>Semana</i>&nbsp;magazine alleged the agents 
illegally wiretapped government and private individuals. According to 
the Attorney Generalâs Office, six criminal investigations against state
 agents had been initiated for surveillance and illegal monitoring of 
private individuals.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-1__subsection-7" class="report__section-subtitle">g. Abuses in Internal Conflict</h3>

					
					<p>The government and the FARC, formerly the countryâs largest 
guerrilla insurgency group, continued to implement the November 2016 
peace accord during the year. The FARC completed its disarmament, and 
former members reincorporated as a political party in 2017. An estimated
 800 to 1,500 FARC dissident members were not participating in the peace
 process. Members of the FARC who did participate in the peace process 
alleged the government had not fully complied with its commitments to 
ensure the security of demobilized former combatants or to facilitate 
their reintegration, while the government alleged the FARC had not met 
its full commitments to cooperate on counternarcotics efforts. The 
Commission for the Clarification of Truth, Coexistence, and 
Non-Repetition, a body founded in accordance with stipulations in the 
peace accord, began its work officially on November 28 and will focus on
 building a shared understanding of the conflictâs causes and effects on
 victims.</p>
<p>The ELN, a smaller leftist guerilla force of approximately 2,000 
armed combatants, continued to commit crimes and acts of terror 
throughout the countryâincluding bombings, violence against civilian 
populations, and violent attacks against military and police 
facilitiesâdespite a brief bilateral cease-fire that concluded in 
January. Illegal armed groups and drug gangs such as the Gulf Clan also 
continued to operate. The CCEEU and other NGOs considered some of these 
illegal armed groups to be composed of former paramilitary groups. The 
government acknowledged that some former paramilitary members were 
active in illegal armed groups but noted these groups lacked the 
national, unified command structure and explicit ideological agenda that
 defined past paramilitary groups, including the disbanded United 
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).</p>
<p><u>Killings</u>: The CCEEU reported 34 deaths it attributed to 
arbitrary or unlawful killings by state agents, many of which occurred 
in the context of armed conflict. In some cases military officials 
stated the killings were military mistakes. In other cases military 
officials stated they believed an individual was fighting on behalf of 
illegal armed groups, while community members stated the victim was not a
 combatant. For example, media reported that Luis Diaz Lopez and Miller 
Diaz Lopez were allegedly killed by members of Army Task Force Quiron 
during confrontations between the army and the ELN on January 18 in 
Tame, Arauca. According to the army, the brothers were identified as 
members of the ELN. Indigenous leaders disputed the armyâs account, 
stating the brothers were members of the Julieros indigenous community 
and asking for clarification into the circumstances behind their deaths.</p>
<p>There were no updates available at yearâs end on the investigation 
into the 2017 killing of Eduardo Antonio Gutierrez by members of the 
army.</p>
<p>Guerrillas, notably the ELN, committed unlawful killings.</p>
<p>For example, on January 27, a bomb in a police station in 
Barranquilla killed five police officers and wounded 42 other persons. 
National Police arrested Camilo Bellon, a member of the ELN, in 
connection with the attack.</p>
<p>Illegal armed groups committed numerous political and unlawful 
killings, primarily in areas under dispute with guerrillas or without a 
strong government presence. The Attorney Generalâs Office reported that 
through August, it had arrested 27 members of illegal armed groups in 
cases involving homicide.</p>
<p>Organized-crime gangs and guerrilla groups killed, threatened, and 
displaced educators and their families for political and financial 
reasons, often because teachers represented the only government presence
 in the remote areas where the killings occurred.</p>
<p>There were no updates available at yearâs end regarding the status of
 the investigation into the 2017 killing of student and social leader 
Ivan Torres Acosta.</p>
<p>Independent observers raised concerns inadequate security guarantees 
were facilitating the killing of former FARC militants. According to the
 September 28&nbsp;<i>Report of the Secretary-General on the UN Verification Mission in Colombia</i>, 71 former FARC combatants had been killed since the signing of the 2016 peace accord.</p>
<p><u>Abductions</u>: Organized-crime gangs, the ELN, and common criminals continued to kidnap persons, both for ransom and for political reasons.</p>
<p>For example, on March 26, members of an illegal armed group kidnapped
 three persons from an Ecuadorian reporting team from the 
newspaper&nbsp;<i>El Comercio</i>&nbsp;and later killed them. On 
November 1, the IACHR reported the Attorney Generalâs Office had made 
âsignificant progressâ in the case, including the capture and 
prosecution of at least three of those responsible for these crimes.</p>
<p>Between January and July, the Ministry of Defense reported 28 
hostages were freed, nine hostages died in captivity, two escaped, and 
16 were released after pressure from the government.</p>
<p>The Special Unit for the Search for Disappeared Persons (UBPD) 
provided for in the peace accord is mandated to account for those who 
disappeared in the context of the armed conflict and, when possible, 
locate and return remains to families. Presidential decrees issued in 
February and August established the UBPDâs internal framework, personnel
 structure, and formally appointed the UBPD director, Luz Marina Monzon.
 According to the Observatory of Memory and Conflict, more than 80,000 
persons were reported missing as a result of the armed conflict, 
including 1,214 military and police officers who were kidnapped by the 
FARC and the ELN.</p>
<p><u>Physical Abuse, Punishment, and Torture</u>: CINEP reported FARC 
dissidents and organized-crime gangs were responsible for six documented
 cases of torture through June 30 (see section 1.c.).</p>
<p>The ELN, FARC dissidents, and other groups continued to lay land 
mines during the year. According to the governmentâs civilian demining 
authority (Descontamina), there were 113 victims of improvised explosive
 devices (IEDs) and land mines during the year, including 72 civilians, 
of whom 20 were children, and 41 were members of the security forces. 
This was a significant increase over the 57 victims in 2017.</p>
<p><u>Child Soldiers</u>: There were reports the ELN and other illegal 
armed groups recruited persons younger than age 18. According to 
Virginia Gamba, special representative of the UN secretary-general for 
children and armed conflict, the ELN was responsible for the majority of
 cases of recruitment of child soldiers, with 113 minors kidnapped by 
the ELN during the year. The second recruiting group was the Gulf Clan, 
which was responsible for 35 kidnappings. Most of these children were 
recruited before 2016. During the year the government launched a program
 called âMy future is todayâ to counter recruitment of child soldiers in
 500 at-risk villages, affecting an estimated 27,000 minors and 15,000 
families. The Attorney Generalâs Office also collected and compiled the 
testimony of 121 children who had been recruited, and authorities issued
 arrest warrants against five members of the Central Command of the ELN 
and 11 other commanders of different blocks.</p>
<p><u>Other Conflict-related Abuses</u>: During the year reports of 
other human rights abuses occurred in the context of the conflict and 
narcotics trafficking. Drug traffickers, guerrilla fighters, and other 
illegal armed groups continued to displace predominantly poor and rural 
populations (see section 2.d., Internally Displaced Persons).</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-2" class="report__section-title">Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Speech and Press</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for freedom of expression, including for the 
press, and the government generally respected this right. Violence and 
harassment, as well as the criminalization of libel, inhibited freedom 
of the press, and the government frequently influenced the press, in 
part through its large advertising budgets. The independent media were 
active and expressed a wide variety of views without restriction.</p>
<p><u>Violence and Harassment</u>: According to the domestic NGO 
Foundation for Press Freedom (FLIP), through August 30, there were 153 
threats against journalists, doubling the 61 threats registered 
throughout 2014 and exceeding the 129 documented in 2017. FLIP also 
reported that between January and August, one journalist was illegally 
detained, 13 were physically assaulted, and 26 were victims of judicial 
harassment based on defamation and slander. As of July the Human Rights 
Unit of the Attorney Generalâs Office was investigating 51 active cases 
of crimes against journalists and had obtained eight sentences.</p>
<p>As of June 30, the National Protection Unit (NPU) provided protection
 services to 168 journalists. Some NGOs raised concerns about perceived 
shortcomings in the NPU, such as delays in granting protection and the 
appropriateness of measures addressing specific threats.</p>
<p><u>Censorship or Content Restrictions</u>: FLIP alleged some 
journalists practiced self-censorship due to fear of being sued under 
libel laws or of being physically attacked, mostly by nongovernment 
actors. FLIP argued the high degree of impunity for those who committed 
aggressions against journalists was also a factor.</p>
<p><u>Libel/Slander Laws</u>: By law slander and libel are crimes. There
 is no specific law against slandering public officials, and the 
government did not use prosecution to prevent media from criticizing 
government policies or public officials. Political candidates, 
businesspersons, and others, however, publicly threatened to sue 
journalists for expressing their opinions, alleging defamation or libel.
 FLIP reported 66 cases were filed against journalists for libel or 
slander as of August 30, including two new cases filed during the year.</p>
<p><u>Nongovernmental Impact</u>: Members of illegal armed groups sought
 to inhibit freedom of expression by intimidating, threatening, 
kidnapping, and killing journalists. National and international NGOs 
reported local media representatives regularly practiced self-censorship
 because of threats of violence from these groups.</p>
<h4>INTERNET FREEDOM</h4>
<p>The government did not restrict or disrupt access to the internet or 
censor online content, and there were no credible reports that the 
government monitored private online communications without appropriate 
legal authority. Due to the general climate of violence and impunity, 
self-censorship occurred both online and offline, particularly within 
rural communities.</p>
<p>The 2016 investigation continued into past abuses by the Army Intelligence Unit (see section 1.f.).</p>
<p>The International Telecommunication Union estimated that 62 percent of the population used the internet in 2017.</p>
<h4>ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND CULTURAL EVENTS</h4>
<p>There were no government restrictions on academic freedom or cultural events.</p>

				</section>

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association, and the government generally respected these rights.</p>
<h4>FREEDOM OF PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY</h4>
<p>The law provides for the freedom of peaceful assembly, and the 
government generally respected this right. Some NGOs alleged that riot 
police (Esmad) used excessive force to break up demonstrations. For 
example, on December 14, media reported eight students were injured as a
 result of confrontations between student protesters and the Esmad in 
Popayan. An unknown number of police officers were also injured.</p>
<h4>FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION</h4>
<p>The law provides for the freedom of association, and the government 
generally respected this right. Freedom of association was limited by 
threats and acts of violence committed by illegal armed groups against 
NGOs, indigenous groups, and labor unions.</p>
<p>Although the government does not prohibit membership in most 
political organizations, membership in organizations that engaged in 
rebellion against the government, espoused violence, or carried out acts
 of violence, such as FARC dissidents, the ELN, and other illegal armed 
groups, was against the law.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-2__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Freedom of Movement, Internally Displaced Persons, Protection of Refugees, and Stateless Persons</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign 
travel, emigration, and repatriation. The government generally respected
 these rights, although there were exceptions. Military operations and 
armed conflict in certain rural areas restricted freedom of movement.</p>
<p>The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in providing 
protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, refugees, 
returning refugees, asylum seekers, stateless persons, and other persons
 of concern.</p>
<p>According to media reports, on August 31, the navy intercepted a 
vessel with 22 migrants from Bangladesh, Cameroon, Cuba, Gambia, India, 
and Pakistan, in the Gulf of Uraba, adjacent to the country. The 
migrants, who allegedly were bound for Central America, were turned over
 to the Migration Directorate, the governmentâs migration monitoring and
 control authority. The Migration Directorate reported that during 2017,
 2,254 Indian citizens, 567 Nepalese, and 510 Bangladeshis were 
identified as being illegally in Colombia; 554 came from Africa.</p>
<p><u>In-country Movement</u>: There were no government restrictions on 
movement within the country. Organized-crime gangs, ELN guerrillas, and 
other illegal armed groups continued to establish illegal checkpoints on
 rural roads.</p>
<p>International organizations also reported that illegal armed groups 
confined rural communities through roadblocks, curfews, car bombs at 
egress routes, and IEDs in areas where narcotics cultivation and 
trafficking persisted. According to the UN Office for the Coordination 
of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), between January and October, more than 
1,037,491 persons faced mobility restrictions that limited their access 
to essential goods and services due to armed incidents and geographical 
factors. This reflected a 750 percent increase compared with the same 
period in 2017. Additionally, OCHA identified 56 events in which 
humanitarian actors and international organizations faced restrictions 
in access to communities by armed groups.</p>
<h4>INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS)</h4>
<p>There were approximately 7.6 million IDPs in the country, largely a 
result of the armed conflict. Threats posed by illegal armed groups 
drove internal displacement in remote areas as well as urban settings. 
In some areas the FARC withdrawal resulted in a struggle for control by 
other illegal armed groups causing violence and internal displacement. 
The government, international organizations, and civil society groups 
identified various factors driving displacement, including threats, 
extortion, and physical, psychological, and sexual violence by illegal 
armed groups against civilian populations, particularly women and girls.
 Competition and armed confrontation among and within illegal armed 
groups for resources and territorial control and confrontations between 
security forces, guerrillas, and organized-crime gangs, in addition to 
forced recruitment of children or threats of forced recruitment, were 
also drivers of displacement. Drug trafficking, illegal mining, and 
large-scale commercial ventures in rural areas also contributed to 
displacement. Local institutions lacked the capacity in many areas to 
protect the rights of, and provide public services to, displaced persons
 and communities at risk of displacement, and as such the government 
struggled to provide adequate protection or humanitarian assistance to 
IDPs.</p>
<p>OCHA reported that 30,068 persons had been affected in 103 
displacement events between January and October. Approximately 45 
percent of the individuals affected were of Afro-Colombian and 
indigenous origin. Departments with the highest rate of mass 
displacements included Antioquia, Cordoba, Choco, Narino, and Norte de 
Santander.</p>
<p>As of July the NPU was providing protection services to 330 land-restitution leaders.</p>
<p>The Victimsâ Unit maintained the Single Victims Registry as mandated 
by law. Despite improvements in the government registration system, IDPs
 experienced delays in receiving responses to their displacement claims 
because of a large backlog of claims built up during several months, 
lack of the unitâs presence in territory, and other constraints. 
Government policy provides for an appeals process in the case of 
refusals.</p>
<p>The ELN and organized-crime gangs continued to use force, 
intimidation, and disinformation to discourage IDPs from registering 
with the government. International organizations and civil society 
expressed concern over urban displacement caused by violence stemming 
from territorial disputes between criminal gangs, some of which had 
links to larger criminal and narcotics-trafficking groups.</p>
<p>The Victimsâ Unit cited extortion, recruitment by illegal armed 
groups, homicides, and physical and sexual violence as the primary 
causes of intraurban displacement. UNHCR reported that in some 
departments displacement disproportionately affected indigenous and 
Afro-Colombian groups.</p>
<p>According to OCHA, 15 percent of the 30,068 persons affected by displacements were indigenous.</p>
<p>The NGO National Association of Displaced Afrodescendants (AFRODES) 
stated that threats and violence against Afro-Colombian leaders and 
communities continued to cause high levels of forced displacement, 
especially in the Pacific Coast region. OCHA reported that approximately
 29 percent of the individuals affected by displacement events were 
Afro-Colombian. AFRODES and other local NGOs expressed concern that 
large-scale economic projects, such as agriculture and mining, 
contributed to displacement in their communities.</p>
<p>By law 52 government agencies are responsible for assisting registered IDPs.</p>
<p>Dozens of international organizations, international NGOs, and 
domestic nonprofit groups, including the International Organization for 
Migration, World Food Program, ICRC, UNHCR, and Colombian Red Cross, 
coordinated with the government to provide emergency relief and 
long-term assistance to displaced populations.</p>
<p>International organizations and NGOs remained concerned about the 
slow and insufficient institutional response to displacement. As a 
result, NGOs took responsibility for providing humanitarian assistance 
to recently displaced individuals. International organizations and civil
 society reported that a continuing lack of local capacity to accept 
registrations in high-displacement areas often delayed assistance to 
persons displaced individually or in smaller groups. Humanitarian 
organizations attributed the delays to a variety of factors, including 
the lack of personnel, funding, declaration forms, and training. 
Insecurity in communities affected by the conflict, including areas in 
the departments of Antioquia, Cauca, Choco, Narino, and Norte de 
Santander, sometimes delayed national and international aid 
organizations from reaching newly displaced populations.</p>
<p>Despite several government initiatives to enhance IDP access to 
services and awareness of their rights, in many parts of the country 
municipalities did not have the resources or capacity to respond to new 
displacements and provide humanitarian assistance to IDPs. Many IDPs 
continued to live in poverty in unhygienic conditions and with limited 
access to health care, education, shelter, and employment.</p>
<p>Displaced persons also sought protection across international 
borders. UNHCR previously stated that Colombia was the country of origin
 for 360,000 refugees and persons in a refugee-like situation, the 
majority in Ecuador, with additional populations in Venezuela, Costa 
Rica, and Panama. UNHCR estimated that between 400 and 500 Colombians 
crossed into Ecuador every month. The governments of Colombia and 
Ecuador continued to meet throughout the year regarding the situation of
 Colombian refugees and asylum seekers in Ecuador, and the Colombian 
government offered a program to assist Colombians abroad who returned to
 Colombia. Additionally, the government estimated that 300,000 
Colombians, many of whom were displaced by the conflict in Colombia and 
registered as refugees in Venezuela, returned to Colombia from Venezuela
 during the year.</p>
<h4>PROTECTION OF REFUGEES</h4>
<p><u>Access to Asylum</u>: The law provides for the granting of asylum 
or refugee status, and the government has established a system for 
providing protection to refugees. According to the government, it had 
approved 47 applications for refugee status since 2009. Between January 1
 and October 2, the government reported it received 1,258 new 
asylum-seeker cases for refugee status, of which three cases were 
approved. Venezuelans represented approximately 95 percent of 
applications during the year. Authorities stated that the asylum process
 took at least one year, during which solicitants were given a permit to
 stay in the country but were not allowed to work.</p>
<p>During the year there was a large increase in migration flows from 
Venezuela. According to the Migration Directorate, as of October the 
country hosted more than one million Venezuelans. While the government 
generally provided access to the asylum process for persons who 
requested international protection, many opted for alternative migration
 status, due to the slow processing time of asylum applications.</p>
<p><u>Temporary Protection</u>: The government also provided temporary 
residence permits (PEP) to Venezuelans who met certain eligibility 
requirements. Approximately 180,000 Venezuelans who entered with 
passports legally were granted PEPs prior to February, when the program 
was discontinued. In June the government announced that 442,462 
irregular Venezuelans who participated in the governmentâs census 
exercise would be eligible for PEPs until December 2. As of November 
approximately 255,000 of the 442,462 Venezuelans eligible for PEPs had 
requested the residence permit, and other Venezuelans were in the 
registration process. A new registration period for the PEP was 
announced December 27. PEPs provide access to work permits, access to 
the social insurance system, and the ability to open bank accounts. The 
temporary residency permit is valid for up to two years.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides citizens the ability to choose their government
 through free and fair periodic elections held by secret ballot and 
based on nearly universal suffrage. Active-duty members of the armed 
forces and police may neither vote nor participate in the political 
process. Civilian public employees are eligible to vote, although they 
may participate in partisan politics only during the four months 
immediately preceding a national election.</p>
<p>As part of the peace accord, the FARC registered a political party 
composed of former FARC members in 2017 under the name Peopleâs 
Alternative Revolutionary Force (<i>Fuerza Alternativa Revolucionaria del Comun</i>),
 maintaining the same acronym. The FARC political party participated in 
the March congressional elections and initially nominated a presidential
 candidate, who withdrew from the race in May. On July 20, FARC 
political party representatives took up eight of their guaranteed 10 
seats in congress.</p>
<h4>Elections and Political Participation</h4>
<p><u>Recent Elections</u>: There were no reports of election-related violence during the June 17 presidential runoff, in which the candidate of the&nbsp;<i>Centro Democratico</i>&nbsp;(Democratic Center) party, Ivan Duque, beat the candidate of&nbsp;<i>Colombia Humana</i>&nbsp;
(Humane Colombia) Gustavo Petro. The then minister of defense Carlos 
Luis Villegas described it as the most peaceful election in decades. The
 leading domestic elections NGO, Electoral Observation Mission, deployed
 3,524 nonpartisan volunteers to monitor the elections. International 
observers included an Electoral Observation Mission of the Organization 
of American States.</p>
<p><u>Political Parties and Political Participation</u>: Organized-crime
 gangs and the ELN threatened and killed government officials (see 
section 1.g.). As of July 31, the NPU, under the Ministry of Interior, 
was providing protection to 353 mayors, 17 governors, and 181 other 
persons, including members of departmental assemblies, council members, 
judges, municipal human rights officers, and other officials related to 
national human rights policies. By decree the CNPâs protection program 
and the NPU assume shared responsibility for protecting municipal and 
district mayors.</p>
<p><u>Participation of Women and Minorities</u>: No laws limit 
participation of women or members of minorities in the political 
process, and they did participate. The share of female officials in 
President Duqueâs cabinet was more than 50 percent.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-4" class="report__section-title">Section 4. Corruption and Lack of Transparency in Government</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>The law provides criminal penalties for official corruption, and
 the government generally implemented these laws effectively, although 
officials sometimes engaged in corrupt practices without punishment. The
 World Bankâs worldwide governance indicators reflected that government 
corruption was a serious problem. Revenues from transnational organized 
crime, including drug trafficking, exacerbated corruption.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: On March 7, the Supreme Court sentenced former top
 anticorruption official Luis Gustavo Moreno Rivera to four years and 10
 months in prison on corruption charges. Related reporting led the 
Attorney Generalâs Office to more than 25 criminal investigations and 
unveiled a corruption network throughout the justice system, other 
government bodies, and Congress. From August 1, 2016, to yearâs end, the
 Attorney Generalâs Office had undertaken approximately 2,330 corruption
 investigations.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: By law public officials must file annual
 financial disclosure forms with the tax authority. The information is 
not made public. The law states that persons who intend to hold public 
office or work as contractors for the government for more than three 
months shall submit a statement of assets and income, as well as 
information on their private economic activity. The Administrative 
Department of Public Service is in charge of preparing the required 
forms, and the human resources chief in each entity is responsible for 
verifying the information submitted. Congress maintained a website on 
which members could voluntarily post their financial information.</p>

			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<p>A wide variety of domestic and international human rights groups
 generally operated without government restriction, investigating and 
publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials 
were typically cooperative and willing to listen to local human rights 
groupsâ concerns.</p>
<p>Several NGOs reported receiving threats in the form of email, mail, 
telephone calls, false obituaries, and objects related to death, such as
 coffins and funeral bouquets. The government condemned the threats and 
called on the Attorney Generalâs Office to investigate them. Some 
activists claimed the government did not take the threats seriously.</p>
<p>The government announced advances in the investigations into attacks 
and killings of human rights defenders and assigned priority resources 
to these cases.</p>
<p>Through August the Attorney Generalâs Office reported 37 active 
investigations, with eight persons charged, and no convictions in cases 
of threats against human rights defenders.</p>
<p>As of July 31, the NPUâs protection program provided protection to a 
total of 6,752 individuals. Among the NPUâs protected persons were 780 
human rights activists.</p>
<p>To help monitor and verify that human rights were respected 
throughout implementation of the peace accord, the government formally 
renewed the mandate of the OHCHR in 2016 for a period of three years. 
The accord requests that the OHCHR include a âspecial chapter on 
implementation of the agreements from the standpoint of human rightsâ in
 its annual reports.</p>
<p><u>Government Human Rights Bodies</u>: The ombudsman is independent, 
submits an annual report to the House of Representatives, and has 
responsibility for providing for the promotion and exercise of human 
rights. According to human rights groups, underfunding of the 
Ombudsmanâs Office limited its ability to monitor violations 
effectively. The ombudsman, as well as members of his regional offices, 
reported threats from illegal armed groups issued through pamphlets, 
email, and violent actions.</p>
<p>The National System for Human Rights and International Humanitarian 
Lawâled by a commission of 18 senior government officials, including the
 vice presidentâdesigns, implements, and evaluates the governmentâs 
policies on human rights and international humanitarian law. The Office 
of the Presidential Advisor for Human Rights coordinates national human 
rights policy and actions taken by government entities to promote or 
protect human rights.</p>
<p>Both the Senate and House of Representatives have human rights 
committees that served as forums for discussion of human rights 
problems.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-6" class="report__section-title">Section 6. Discrimination, Societal Abuses, and Trafficking in Persons</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
					<h4>Women</h4>
<p><u>Rape and Domestic Violence</u>: Although prohibited by law, rape 
of men or women, including spousal rape, remained a serious problem. The
 law provides for sentences ranging from eight to 30 yearsâ imprisonment
 for violent sexual assault. For acts of spousal sexual violence, the 
law mandates prison sentences of six months to two years. By law 
femicide is punishable with penalties of 21 to 50 years in prison, 
longer than the minimum sentence of 13 years for homicide.</p>
<p>Violence against women, and impunity for perpetrators, continued to 
be a problem. Members of illegal armed groups, including former 
paramilitary members, and guerrillas also continued to rape and abuse 
women and children sexually. For example, an August 1 report by the 
Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia of the Organization of 
American States detailed its âconcern about the continuation and, in 
some cases, exacerbation of violence against women and girls.â</p>
<p>The government continued to employ the Elite Sexual Assault 
Investigative Unit interagency unit in Bogota, which was dedicated to 
the investigation of sexual assault cases. From January to August, the 
Attorney Generalâs Office opened 28,942 new investigations for sexual 
crimes.</p>
<p>The law requires the government to provide victims of domestic 
violence immediate protection from further physical or psychological 
abuse. During 2017 more than 70,000 cases of intrafamily violence were 
reported.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense continued implementing its protocol for 
managing cases of sexual violence and harassment involving members of 
the military. The District Secretary of Women, in Bogota, and the 
Ombudsmanâs Office offered free legal aid for victims of gender violence
 and organized courses to teach officials how to treat survivors of 
gender violence respectfully.</p>
<p>The law augments both jail time and fines if a crime causes 
âtransitory or permanent physical disfigurement,â such as acid attacks, 
which have a penalty of up to 50 years in prison. Acid attacks remained a
 problem and predominately targeted women. In August a woman in Cauca 
attacked her sister-in-law with acid, burning the victimâs eye, face, 
and neck. There were no updates on advances in this case at yearâs end.</p>
<p><u>Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C)</u>: The law prohibits 
FGM/C, but isolated incidents were reported in several indigenous 
communities in different parts of the country. Two-thirds of women from 
the Embera community had undergone FGM/C, according to the UN Population
 Fund.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Harassment</u>: The law provides measures to deter and 
punish harassment in the workplace, such as sexual harassment, verbal 
abuse or derision, aggression, and discrimination, which carries a 
penalty of one to three yearsâ imprisonment. Nonetheless, NGOs reported 
sexual harassment remained a pervasive and underreported problem in 
workplaces and in public.</p>
<p><u>Coercion in Population Control</u>: Coerced abortion is not 
permitted under the law. The law allows the involuntary surgical 
sterilization of children with cognitive and psychosocial disabilities 
in certain cases.</p>
<p>Through August 18, the Attorney Generalâs Office reported it opened 15 investigations related to cases of forced abortion.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: Although women have the same legal rights as 
men, serious discrimination against women persisted. The Office of the 
Advisor for the Equality of Women has primary responsibility for 
combating discrimination against women, but advocacy groups reported 
that the office remained seriously underfunded. The government continued
 its national public policy for gender equity.</p>
<h4>Children</h4>
<p><u>Birth Registration</u>: Citizenship is derived by birth within the
 countryâs territory in most cases. Most births were registered 
immediately. If a birth is not registered within one month, parents may 
be fined and denied public services.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: Child abuse was a serious problem. The ICBF 
reported between January and July 31, there were 8,039 cases of sexual 
abuse against children. According to the National Council of Economic 
and Social Policy (CONPES), the government reported in October that the 
ICBF had undertaken 740 instances to address violations against 
Venezuelan children.</p>
<p><u>Early and Forced Marriage</u>: Marriage is legal at age 18. Boys 
older than age 14 and girls older than age 12 may marry with the consent
 of their parents. According to UNICEF, 5 percent of girls were married 
before age 15 and 23 percent before the age of 18.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: Sexual exploitation of 
children remained a problem. The law prohibits sexual exploitation of a 
minor or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a minor and stipulates a
 penalty of 14 to 25 years in prison, with aggravated penalties for 
perpetrators who are family members of the victim and for cases of 
sexual tourism, forced marriage, or sexual exploitation by illegal armed
 groups. The law prohibits pornography using children younger than age 
18 and stipulates a penalty of 10 to 20 years in prison and a fine. The 
minimum age for consensual sex is 14. The penalty for sexual activity 
with a child younger than age 14 ranges from nine to 13 years in prison.
 The government generally enforced the law.</p>
<p>According to the ICBF, between January and July 31, there were 151 
reported cases of sexual exploitation of children. The Attorney 
Generalâs Office reported opening 837 investigations related to cases of
 child pornography and 334 cases of sexual exploitation of minors, with 
one conviction reported during the year. In July authorities in 
Cartagena conducted a three-day operation, arrested 18 persons, and 
charged them with the sexual exploitation of more than 250 women and 
girls. According to press reports, the trafficking ring was led by 
Liliana Campos Puello and retired marine infantry captain Raul Danilo 
Romero Pabon. Prosecutors alleged that some of the women and girls were 
tattooed and trafficked for purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. 
Media reported authorities conducted several raids to dismantle networks
 of sexual exploitation of minors in Cartagena and other cities as of 
December 12. In total, 42 persons were captured and goods valued at 
Colombian pesos (COP) 154 billion ($49 million) were seized.</p>
<p><u>Displaced Children</u>: The NGO Consultancy for Human Rights and 
Displacement estimated in 2016 that 31 percent of persons registered as 
displaced since 1985 were minors at the time they were displaced (see 
also section 2.d.). According to CONPES, the government reported in 
October that approximately 27 percent of Venezuelans registered in the 
governmentâs yet-to-be-released 2018 census were minors, of whom 
approximately half had received government services.</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is a party to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. See the Department of Stateâs&nbsp;<i>Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction</i>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191218142024/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data.html">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/for-providers/legal-reports-and-data.html</a>.</p>
<h4>Anti-Semitism</h4>
<p>The Jewish community, which had an estimated 5,000 members, continued
 to report instances of anti-Israeli rhetoric connected to events in the
 Middle East, accompanied by anti-Semitic graffiti near synagogues, as 
well as demonstrations in front of the Israeli embassy that were 
sometimes accompanied by anti-Semitic comments on social media. In 
particular the Colombian Confederation of Jewish Communities expressed 
concern over the presence of BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) 
Colombia, which aggressively promotes the boycott of Israeli products, 
culture, and travel and does not actively counter the conflation of 
anti-Israeli policies with anti-Semitic rhetoric.</p>
<h4>Trafficking in Persons</h4>
<p>See the Department of Stateâs&nbsp;<i>Trafficking in Persons Report</i>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191218142024/http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/">www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/</a>.</p>
<h4>Persons with Disabilities</h4>
<p>The law punishes those who arbitrarily restrict the full exercise of 
the rights of persons with disabilities or harass persons with 
disabilities, but enforcement was rare. The law prohibits discrimination
 against persons with physical and mental disabilities but does not 
explicitly prohibit discrimination against persons with sensory or 
intellectual disabilities. No law mandates access to information and 
telecommunications for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>The Office of the Presidential Advisor for Human Rights under the 
High Counselor for Post-Conflict, Public Security, and Human Rights, 
along with the Human Rights Directorate at the Ministry of Interior, is 
responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities. 
According to Somos Defensores and other NGOs, the law was seldom 
enforced.</p>
<p>Although children with disabilities attended school at all levels, 
advocates noted the vast majority of teachers and schools were neither 
trained nor equipped to educate children with disabilities successfully.
 Advocacy groups also stated children with disabilities entered the 
education system later than children without disabilities and dropped 
out at higher rates. Persons with disabilities were unemployed at a much
 higher rate than the general population.</p>
<p>In 2013 the State Council ordered all public offices to make 
facilities accessible to persons with disabilities and asked public 
officials to include requirements for accessibility when granting 
licenses for construction and occupancy. The State Council also asked 
every municipality to enforce rules that would make all public offices 
accessible to persons with disabilities âin a short amount of time.â It 
was not clear if much progress had been made.</p>
<h4>National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities</h4>
<p>According to the 2005 national census, the most recent census 
available at the time of drafting, approximately 4.5 million persons, or
 10 percent of the countryâs population, described themselves as being 
of African descent. A 2011 UN report estimated Afro-Colombians made up 
15 to 20 percent of the population, while human rights groups and 
Afro-Colombian organizations estimated the proportion to be 20 to 25 
percent.</p>
<p>Afro-Colombians are entitled to all constitutional rights and 
protections, but they faced significant economic and social 
discrimination. According to a 2016 UN report, 32 percent of the 
countryâs population lived below the poverty line, but in Choco, the 
department with the highest percentage of Afro-Colombian residents, 79 
percent of residents lived below the poverty line.</p>
<p>In 2010 the government approved a policy to promote equal opportunity
 for black, Afro-Colombian, Palenquera, and Raizal populations. 
(Palenquera populations inhabit some parts of the Caribbean coast, 
Raizal populations live in the San Andres archipelago, and Blacks and 
Afro-Colombians are Colombians of African descent who self-identify 
slightly differently based on their unique linguistic and cultural 
heritages.) The Ministry of Interior provided technical advice and 
funding for social projects presented by Afro-Colombian communities.</p>
<p>The National Autonomous Congress of Afro-Colombian Community Councils
 and Ethnic Organizations for Blacks, Afro-Colombians, Raizales, and 
Palenqueras, consisting of 108 representatives, met with government 
representatives on problems that affected their communities.</p>
<h4>Indigenous People</h4>
<p>The constitution and law give special recognition to the fundamental 
rights of indigenous persons, who make up approximately 3.4 percent of 
the population, and require the government to consult beforehand with 
indigenous groups regarding governmental actions that could affect them.</p>
<p>The law accords indigenous groups perpetual rights to their ancestral
 lands, but indigenous groups, neighboring landowners, and the 
government often disputed the demarcation of those lands. Traditional 
indigenous groups operated 710 reservations, accounting for 
approximately 28 percent of the countryâs territory. Illegal armed 
groups often violently contested indigenous land ownership and recruited
 indigenous children to join their ranks.</p>
<p>The law provides for special criminal and civil jurisdictions within 
indigenous territories based on traditional community laws. Legal 
proceedings in these jurisdictions were subject to manipulation and 
often rendered punishments more lenient than those imposed by regular 
civilian courts.</p>
<p>Some indigenous groups continued to assert they were not able to 
participate adequately in decisions affecting their lands. The 
constitution provides for this âprior consultationâ mechanism for 
indigenous communities, but it does not require the government to obtain
 the consent of those communities in all cases.</p>
<p>The government stated that for security reasons it could not provide 
advance notice of most military operations, especially when in pursuit 
of enemy combatants, and added that it consulted with indigenous leaders
 when possible before entering land held by the communities.</p>
<p>Despite special legal protections and government assistance programs,
 indigenous persons continued to suffer discrimination and often lived 
on the margins of society. They belonged to the countryâs poorest 
population and had the highest age-specific mortality rates.</p>
<p>Killings of members and leaders of indigenous groups remained a 
problem. According to the NGO National Indigenous Organization of 
Colombia, since the signing of the peace accord, 46 indigenous persons 
have been killed.</p>
<p>Despite precautionary measures ordered by the IACHR, ethnic Wayuu 
children continued to die of malnutrition. The United Nations and the 
government reported an increase in binational Wayuu families, including 
children, arriving in Colombia as a result of deteriorating conditions 
in Venezuela. Several hundred members of the Venezuelan Yukpa tribe 
crossed into Colombia in April due to deteriorating conditions in 
Venezuela. The government worked with the United Nations to provide the 
population basic services.</p>
<h4>Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h4>
<p>There were no reports of official discrimination based on sexual 
orientation in employment, housing, statelessness, or access to 
education or health care. A 2015 Constitutional Court decision required 
that the Ministry of Education modify its educational materials to 
address discrimination in schools based on sexual orientation or gender 
identity.</p>
<p>Transgender individuals cited barriers to public services when 
health-care providers or police officers refused to accept their 
government-issued identification. Some transgender individuals stated it
 was difficult to change the gender designation on national identity 
documents and that transgender individuals whose identity cards listed 
them as male were still required to show proof they had performed 
mandatory military service or obtained the necessary waivers from that 
service. NGOs claimed discrimination and violence in prisons against 
persons due to their sexual orientation and gender identity remained a 
problem.</p>
<p>Despite government measures to increase the rights and protection of 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons, there
 were reports of societal abuse and discrimination, as well as sexual 
assault. NGOs claimed transgender individuals, particularly transgender 
men, were often sexually assaulted in so-called corrective rape. The 
Constitutional Court pronounced in 2016 that transgender persons faced 
discrimination and social rejection within the LGBTI community and 
recommended measures to increase respect for transgender identities in 
the classrooms.</p>
<p>As of September 18, the Attorney Generalâs Office was investigating 
at least two alleged homicides of LGBTI individuals. Investigations into
 crimes committed by members of the security forces did not appear in 
the Attorney Generalâs Office system. NGO Colombia Diversa reported six 
cases, involving eight victims, of police abuse of persons due to their 
sexual orientation or gender identity, with the majority of complaints 
coming from transgender individuals.</p>
<p>NGOs reported several cases of threats against LGBTI human rights 
defenders, as well as a high level of impunity for crimes against LGBTI 
persons. Such organizations partially attributed impunity levels to the 
failure of the Attorney Generalâs Office to distinguish and effectively 
pursue crimes against LGBTI persons.</p>
<h4>HIV and AIDS Social Stigma</h4>
<p>There were no confirmed reports of societal violence or 
discrimination against persons with HIV/AIDS. In its most recent 
demographic and health survey (2010), the government reported the 
responses of 85 percent of those surveyed indicated discriminatory 
attitudes towards persons with HIV/AIDS, reflecting low levels of social
 acceptance throughout the country.</p>

			<h2 id="report-toc__section-7" class="report__section-title">Section 7. Worker Rights</h2>


			<!-- Sub-Sections -->

			
				
				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-1" class="report__section-subtitle">a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h3>

					
					<p>The law provides for the right of workers to form and join 
unions, bargain collectively, and conduct legal strikes, and it 
prohibits antiunion discrimination. Members of associated workersâ 
cooperatives are not allowed to form unions, since the law recognizes 
members of a cooperative as owners. The law prohibits members of the 
armed forces and police from forming or joining unions. The law provides
 for automatic recognition of unions that obtain 25 signatures from 
potential members and that comply with a registration process. 
Public-sector employees legally have the right to bargain collectively. 
The government and employers generally respected freedom of association 
and collective bargaining in practice. Workers faced some obstacles to 
exercising those rights, and the government faced numerous challenges 
effectively enforcing applicable laws governing those two rights.</p>
<p>The law permits associated workersâ cooperatives (CTAs), collective 
pacts, and union contracts. Under collective pacts employers may 
negotiate accords on pay and labor conditions with workers in workplaces
 where no union is present or where a union represents less than 
one-third of employees. Law and regulations prohibit the use of CTAs and
 collective pacts to undermine the right to organize and bargain 
collectively, including by extending better conditions to nonunion 
workers through such pacts. Through a union contract, a company may 
contract a union, at times formed explicitly for this purpose, for a 
specific job or work; the union then in essence serves as an employer 
for its members. Workers who belong to a union that has a union contract
 with a company do not have a direct employment relationship with either
 the company or the union. Labor disputes for workers under a union 
contract may be decided through an arbitration panel versus labor courts
 if both parties agree.</p>
<p>The law does not permit members of the armed forces, police, and 
persons performing âessential public servicesâ to strike. Before 
conducting a strike, unions must follow prescribed legal procedures, 
including entering into a conversation period with the employer, 
presenting a list of demands, and gaining majority approval in the union
 for a strike. The law limits strikes to periods of contract 
negotiations or collective bargaining and allows employers to fire trade
 unionists who participate in strikes or work stoppages ruled illegal by
 the courts.</p>
<p>The government has the authority to fine labor-rights violators. The 
government sought to enforce most applicable labor laws, but a lack of 
an inspection strategy, as well as an overburdened judicial system, 
inhibited speedy and consistent application. The maximum penalty for 
violations of law, including those that prohibit the misuse of CTAs, is 
5,000 times the minimum monthly wage, or COP 3.4 billion ($1.07 
million), which is sufficient to deter violations if levied 
consistently. The law also stipulates that offenders repeatedly misusing
 CTAs or other labor relationships shall receive the maximum penalty and
 may be subject to losing their legal status to operate. Employers who 
engage in antiunion practices may also be imprisoned for up to five 
years, although government officials admitted a fine was more likely 
than imprisonment. Prohibited practices include impeding workersâ right 
to strike, meet, or otherwise associate, and extending better conditions
 to members of collective pacts than to union members. Through the first
 nine months of the year, the government reported finalizing 55 fines on
 certain subcontracting entities for abusive forms of subcontracting at a
 value of COP 8.24 billion ($2.6 million).</p>
<p>The Ministry of Laborâs Special Investigations Unit continued to 
exercise its power to investigate and impose sanctions in any 
jurisdiction. The vice minister for labor relations decides on a 
case-by-case basis whether to assign the Special Investigations Unit or 
the regional inspectors to investigate certain sites. The unit was 
reportedly overburdened with cases, resulting in denials of recent union
 requests for review by the unit.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor leads a tripartite Inter-Institutional 
Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Human Rights of 
Workers, with participation by the government, organized labor groups, 
and business community. The commission met three times during the year, 
in the departments of Valle del Cauca and Cauca.</p>
<p>As part of its commitments under the 2011 Colombian Action Plan 
Related to Labor Rights (Labor Action Plan), the government continued to
 take steps to protect internationally recognized labor rights. Labor 
inspections by the Ministry of Labor for abusive subcontracting in the 
five priority sectors of palm oil, sugar, ports, mines, and cut flowers 
remained infrequent, however. Critics claimed inspections lacked 
necessary rigor, assessed fines were not collected, and abusive 
subcontracting continued. In the first nine months of the year, there 
appeared to be no fines collected for illegal labor intermediation in 
any of the five priority sectors, and only one new fine was imposed for 
this violation in each of the cut flower and mining sectors. The 
government continued to engage in regular meetings with unions and civil
 society groups.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor, in collaboration with the International Labor 
Organization (ILO), continued a virtual training program to prepare 
labor inspectors to identify antiunion conduct. It also implemented 
methods, including contract and process maps, as strategic planning 
tools to prioritize interventions. The ministry continued to employ a 
telephone- and internet-based complaint mechanism to report alleged 
labor violations. Union members complained that existing systems did not
 allow citizens to register anonymous complaints and noted that 
complaints registered through the telephone and internet systems do not 
result in action.</p>
<p>Judicial police, the Technical Investigation Body, and prosecutors 
investigating criminal cases of threats and killings are required to 
determine during the initial phase of an investigation whether a victim 
is an active or retired union member or is actively engaged in union 
formation and organization, but it was unclear whether they did so. It 
could take several months to transfer cases from regional field offices 
of the Attorney Generalâs Office to the Attorney Generalâs Human Rights 
Directorate, and cases are transferred only with the approval of the 
attorney general in response to direct requests, instead of 
automatically.</p>
<p>The government continued to include in its protection program for 
labor activists persons engaged in efforts to form a union, as well as 
former unionists under threat because of their past activities. Through 
July the NPU provided protection to 377 trade union leaders or members 
(others protected included 168 journalists, 780 human rights advocates, 
and 330 land restitution claimants). Approximately 8.6 percent of the 
NPUâs budget was dedicated to unionist protection. Between January 1 and
 July, the NPU processed 306 risk assessments of union leaders or 
members; 100 of those cases were assessed as posing an âextraordinary 
threat,â and the NPU provided them protection measures. The NPU reported
 that during the year the average time needed to implement protection 
measures upon completion of a risk analysis was 65 days in regular cases
 or five days for emergency cases. NGOs, however, complained about slow 
processing times.</p>
<p>The protection and relocation of teachers falls under the Ministry of
 National Education and the departmental education secretaries, but the 
NPU retains some responsibilities for the risk analysis and protection 
of family members. Through July 31, the NPU evaluated 341 threat cases 
against teachers and found 74 to be of extraordinary risk.</p>
<p>In cases of unionist killings from previous years, the pace of 
investigations and convictions remained slow, and high rates of impunity
 continued. Labor groups stated more needed to be done to address 
impunity for perpetrators of violence against trade unionists and the 
large number of threat cases. The Attorney Generalâs Office indicated it
 prioritized cases in order of severity and had a backlog of 
lower-priority cases. As of July 31, the Attorney Generalâs Office 
reported 765 sentences against 626 persons in cases of violence against 
unionists since 2006 that were filed in the Human Rights Directorate.</p>
<p>Violence, threats, harassment, and other practices against trade 
unionists continued to affect the exercise of the right to freedom of 
association and collective bargaining. According to the Attorney 
Generalâs Office, through September 19, 10 teachers were registered as 
victims in cases of homicide.</p>
<p>The Attorney Generalâs Office reported the killing of 18 trade 
unionists during the year. There was progress in the investigation of 
several of these cases, with one case already receiving a sentence and 
four cases in the prosecution phase. The National Union School (ENS), a 
labor rights NGO and think tank, reported 28 trade unionists were 
killed. ENS and other labor groups stated that focusing on killings 
alone masked the true nature and scope of the violence against labor 
activists. Labor groups noted that in some regions nonlethal violations 
continued to increase. ENS reported 136 death threats, six nonlethal 
attacks, two cases of forced displacement, four cases of harassment, and
 one illegal raid.</p>
<p>Unions cited multiple instances in which companies fired employees 
who formed or sought to form new unions. Some employers continued to use
 temporary contracts, service agencies, and other forms of 
subcontracting, including cooperatives, to limit worker rights and 
protections. Fines assessed by the government did little to dissuade 
violators because fines were often not collected. Formalization 
agreements in firms with illegal subcontracting increased during the 
year. In the first nine months of the year, the government reported 
2,606 workers benefited from 29 formalization agreements that the 
Ministry of Labor reached with employers in key sectors, including 
agriculture, mining, manufacturing, education, and transport. Labor 
rights groups expressed concern that previously signed formalization 
agreements were not sufficiently monitored by the ministry.</p>
<p>Labor confederations and NGOs reported that business owners in 
several sectors used âsimplified stock corporationsâ (SAS), union 
contracts, foundations, or temporary service agencies in attempts to 
circumvent legal restrictions on cooperatives. While in theory SAS 
workers may exercise their right to organize and bargain collectively 
with SAS management, it appeared that in some cases the SAS had little 
or no control over the conditions of employment. The Ministry of Labor 
stated that an SAS, like any corporate structure, may be fined for labor
 violations if they occurred. Labor confederations and NGOs reported 
these enforcement actions did not address the scope of abusive 
subcontracting and illegal labor intermediation in the country.</p>
<p>According to ENS, Indupalma, a large employer in the palm sector 
located in the municipality of San Alberto, Cesar Department, previously
 fined for employing more than 1,200 workers through illegal 
cooperatives, formalized 592 workers in October through a formalization 
agreement reached with the Ministry of Labor.</p>
<p>Metal and mineworkersâ union SINTRAIME reported that inspections for 
abusive subcontracting carried out by the Ministry of Labor at the 
Drummond coalmines were ineffective in safeguarding the freedom of 
workers to organize.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-2" class="report__section-subtitle">b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor. The 
government did not effectively enforce the law in all cases, and there 
continued to be reports that such practices occurred. The law prescribes
 punishments of 13 to 23 yearsâ imprisonment plus fines for forced labor
 violations.</p>
<p>There were reports ELN guerrillas and organized-crime gangs used 
forced labor, including forced child labor, in coca cultivation and 
illegal mining in areas outside government control as well as forced 
criminality, such as extortion, in urban areas. The ICBF indicated that 
between November 16, 1999, and July 31, the number of children and 
adolescents who had demobilized was 6,512, of whom 709 were indigenous 
and 482 Afro-Colombian. As part of a temporary bilateral cease-fire 
between the government and the ELN from October 1, 2017, to January 9, 
the ELN committed to stop the recruitment of minors. High Commissioner 
for Peace Miguel Ceballos, however, indicated the ELN continued to 
recruit minors during the year.</p>
<p>Forced labor in other sectors, including organized begging, mining, 
agriculture, forced recruitment by illegal armed actors, and domestic 
service, also remained a serious problem. Afro-Colombians, indigenous 
Colombians, and inhabitants of marginalized urban areas were at the 
highest risk of forced labor, domestic servitude, forced begging, and 
forced recruitment. In September authorities in Bogota sentenced Claudia
 Maritza Castiblanco Parra to 12 years in prison on conviction for the 
forced labor of an indigenous woman hired as a domestic servant. This 
was the first conviction for labor trafficking of an individual in 
domestic servitude.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-3" class="report__section-subtitle">c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h3>

					
					<p>The law sets the minimum age for employment at 15 and for 
hazardous work at 18. Children 15 and 16 years of age may work no more 
than 30 hours per week, and children age 17 may work no more than 40 
hours per week. Children younger than age 15 may work in arts, sports, 
or recreational or cultural activities for a maximum of 14 hours per 
week. In all these cases, working children and adolescents must have 
signed documentation filed by their parents and approved by a labor 
inspector or other local authority.</p>
<p>The law prohibits child workers from working at night or where there 
is a risk of bodily harm or exposure to excessive heat, cold, or noise. 
During the year the government updated its hazardous work regulations in
 consultation with employersâ and workersâ organizations to include an 
extensive list of 36 kinds of activities that are prohibited to 
children, including in agriculture, hunting and forestry, fishing, 
mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction, transport and 
storage, health services, and defense.</p>
<p>The law authorizes inspectors to issue fines of up to 5,000 times the
 minimum monthly wage for labor law violations, including child-labor 
violations, which would be sufficient to deter violations, but the 
government did not enforce the law effectively in all cases. A violation
 deemed to endanger a childâs life or threaten moral values may be 
punished by temporary or permanent closure of the establishment. 
Nationwide, labor inspectors are responsible for enforcing child labor 
laws and supervising the formal sector through periodic inspections. An 
estimated 80 percent of all child labor, however, occurred in the 
informal sector of the economy.</p>
<p>Government agencies carried out several activities to eradicate and 
prevent exploitative child labor. With ILO assistance the government 
continued to improve cooperation among national, regional, and municipal
 governments on child labor issues. It also continued to employ a 
monitoring system to register working children, although the system was 
not always regularly updated. The government also sought to reduce 
demand for child labor through public awareness and training efforts, 
often working with international and civil society organizations.</p>
<p>The government, through the Ministry of Labor, followed the National 
Policy to Prevent and Eliminate Child Labor and Protect the Young 
Worker, adopted in 2017. It also continued its roundtable discussion 
group, which included government representatives, members of the three 
largest labor confederations, and civil society. The group concentrated 
its efforts on formalizing an integrated registration system for 
information on child labor that would permit public and private entities
 to register information about child workers.</p>
<p>The government continued to combat illegal mining and formalize 
artisanal mining production, with goals including the elimination of 
child labor and forced labor. Regional ICBF offices were charged with 
leading efforts to combat child labor in mining at the local level, 
working with the Ministry of Labor and other government agencies to 
coordinate responses. The Department for Social Prosperity continued to 
implement the More Families in Action program to combat poverty through 
conditional cash transfers; it included a specific focus on addressing 
child labor. In interagency child labor meetings, the Ministry of Labor 
reported that whichever government presence was available in the 
areaâwhether police, the ICBF, teachers, or the Administrative 
Department for Social Prosperityâattended to children found working in 
illegal mining operations. While all agencies had directives on how to 
handle and report child labor cases, it was unclear whether all cases 
were referred to the ICBF.</p>
<p>The ICBF continued to implement several initiatives aimed at 
preventing child labor, including producing an extensive section of its 
website designed specifically for young audiences to educate children on
 child labor, their rights, and how to report child labor. The Ministry 
of Labor continued its work with the Network against Child Labor, in 
which the ministry operates alongside member businesses that pledged to 
work within the network to prevent and eradicate child labor.</p>
<p>Child labor remained a problem in the informal and illicit sectors. 
Although the government does not publish data on child labor, the 
National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) collects and 
publishes information on the economic activities of children ages five 
to 17 through a module in its Comprehensive Household Economic Survey 
during the fourth quarter of each calendar year. According to DANEâs 
2017 survey, 7 percent of children were working, with 44 percent engaged
 in agriculture, livestock raising, fishing, and hunting, and 30 percent
 in commerce, hotels, and restaurant work. To a lesser extent, children 
engaged in the manufacturing and transport sectors. Children also 
routinely performed domestic work, where they cared for children, 
prepared meals, tended gardens, and carried out shopping duties.</p>
<p>Significant rates of child labor occurred in the production of clay 
bricks, coal, emeralds, gold, coca, and pornography. Children were also 
engaged in child labor in street vending, domestic work, begging, and 
garbage scavenging. There were also reports that children engaged in 
child labor in agriculture, including coffee production and small family
 production centers in the unrefined brown sugar market, as well as 
selling inexpensive Venezuelan gasoline. Commercial sexual exploitation 
of children occurred (see section 6, Children).</p>
<p>Prohibitions against children working in mining and construction were
 reportedly largely ignored. Some educational institutions modify 
schedules during harvest seasons so that children may help on the family
 farm. Children worked in artisanal mining of coal, clay, emeralds, and 
gold under dangerous conditions and in many instances with the approval 
or insistence of their parents. The governmentâs efforts to assist 
children working in illegal mining focused on the departments of 
Antioquia and Boyaca.</p>
<p>There continued to be instances of child trafficking with the purpose
 of forced labor in mines, quarries, and private homes. According to 
government officials and international organizations, illegal drug 
traders and other illicit actors recruited children, sometimes forcibly,
 to work in their illegal activities. The ELN and organized-crime gangs 
forced children into sexual servitude or criminality to serve as 
combatants or coca pickers (see section 1.g.). Children working in the 
informal sector, including as street vendors, were also vulnerable to 
labor trafficking. The ICBF identified children and adolescents who 
qualified for and received social services.</p>

						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-4" class="report__section-subtitle">d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h3>

					
					<p>The law prohibits discrimination with respect to employment or 
occupation based on race, ethnicity, sex, religion, political 
preference, national origin or citizenship, gender, disability, 
language, sexual orientation or gender identity, HIV-positive status or 
infection with other communicable diseases, or social status. Complaints
 of quid pro quo sexual harassment are filed not with the Ministry of 
Labor but with the criminal courts. The government did not effectively 
enforce the law in all cases.</p>
<p>Unemployment disproportionately affected women, who faced hiring 
discrimination and received salaries that generally were not 
commensurate with their education and experience. Sisma Mujer reported 
on average women were paid 28 percent less than men. In a previous year,
 a senior government official estimated that 85 percent of persons with 
disabilities were unemployed. Afro-Colombian labor unions reported 
discrimination in the port sector.</p>

				<section class="entry-content">

					
						<h3 id="report-toc__section-7__subsection-5" class="report__section-subtitle">e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h3>

					
					<p>The legal minimum monthly wage is roughly twice the amount of 
the poverty line; however, almost half of the total workforce earned 
less than the minimum wage.</p>
<p>The law provides for a regular workweek of 48 hours and a minimum 
rest period of eight hours within the week. Exceptions to this may be 
granted by the Ministry of Labor and were frequently granted in the 
mining sector. The law stipulates that workers receive premium 
compensation for nighttime work, hours worked in excess of 48 per week, 
and work performed on Sundays. The law permits compulsory overtime only 
in exceptional cases where the work is considered essential for the 
companyâs functioning.</p>
<p>The law provides for workersâ occupational safety and health in the 
formal sector. The legal standards were generally up to date and 
appropriate for the main formal industries. The law does not cover 
informal-sector workers, including many mining and agricultural workers.
 In general the law protects workersâ rights to remove themselves from 
situations that endanger health or safety without jeopardy to their 
employment, although some violations of this right were reported during 
the year. In cases of formal grievances, authorities generally protected
 employees in this situation.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor is required to enforce labor laws in the formal
 sector, including occupational safety and health regulations, through 
periodic inspections by labor inspectors. The government reported that 
as of April, the ministry employed 868 inspectors countrywide, although 
not all conducted worksite inspections; 778 of them were in provisional 
appointments. In April the Civil Service Commission held a national exam
 that produced a list of eligible candidates for permanent appointment 
as labor inspectors and other civil servant positions. The exam was 
challenged, potentially delaying appointments. Individual labor 
violations can bring fines of up to 5,000 times the minimum monthly 
wage, but infractions for occupational safety and health can trigger 
fines of only up to 1,000 times the minimum monthly wage. Unionists 
stated that more fines needed to be collected to impact occupational 
safety and health issues.</p>
<p>While the governmentâs labor inspectors undertook administrative 
actions to enforce the minimum wage in the formal sector, the government
 did not conduct any action to do so in the informal sector.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labor continued to promote formal employment 
generation. As of the third quarter of the year, DANE reported that 8.6 
million, or 39 percent, of the 22 million workers employed nationwide 
pay into the pension system. The proportion of informal workers in 
cities and metropolitan areas was 48 percent, according to DANE. The 
government continued to support complementary social security programs 
to increase the employability of extremely poor individuals, displaced 
persons, and the elderly.</p>
<p>Nonunion workers, particularly those in the agricultural and port 
sectors, reportedly worked under hazardous conditions because they 
feared losing their jobs through subcontracting mechanisms or informal 
arrangements if they criticized abuses. Some unionized workers who 
alleged they suffered on-the-job injuries complained that companies 
illegally fired them in retaliation for filing workers compensation 
claims. Only the courts may order reinstatement, and workers complained 
the courts were backlogged, slow, and corrupt. The Ministry of Labor may
 sanction a company found to have broken the law in this way, but it may
 offer no other guarantees to workers.</p>
<p>Security forces reported that illegal armed actors, including FARC 
dissidents, the ELN, and organized-crime groups, engaged in illegal 
mining of gold, coal, coltan, nickel, copper, and other minerals. 
Illegal mines were particularly common in the departments of Antioquia, 
Bolivar, Cauca, Cordoba, Choco, Narino, and Tolima.</p>
<p>According to the National Mining Agency, through August 23, a total 
of 61 workers died as a result of accidents in the mines, the majority 
due to cave-ins.</p>
